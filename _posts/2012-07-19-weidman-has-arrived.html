The kid's for real, folks. Granted, if Hector Lombard goes out and knocks the block off Tim Boetsch it'd be hard for the UFC to avoid making the matchup of Lombard vs Silva, but I'm here to tell ya, Weidman is no joke and would give Anderson a lot to think about. So now we have a bevy of challengers for the belt:

BELCHER
WEIDMAN
winner of LOMBARD vs. BOETSCH

Chomping at the bit: winner of Stann vs. Bisping

BELFORT could also weasel into the picture with another win or two.
