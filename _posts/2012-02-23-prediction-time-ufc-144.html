Man, this is a tough one to call.  But hey, that's why I get the big bucks.    Oh wait.

&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">PRELIMINARY CARD (Facebook)</span>
<h2>Issei Tamura vs. Tiequan Zhang</h2>
Tamura is a bit green, a bit short for the featherweight division. Although it'd be nice to start the night with a win for Japan, this should be Zhang's fight to lose.   ZHANG by SUBMISSION.

&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">PRELIMINARY CARD (FX)</span>
<h2>Chris Cariaso vs. Takeya Mizugaki</h2>
Mizugaki has a hard time getting any momentum. He hasn't won two in a row since 2008. That said, he hasn't lost two in a row in more than 5 years. I think the win against Cole Escovedo will boost his confidence for this fight, and he'll employ his reach advantage to keep Cariaso at bay.  It's close, but the local boy should pull it out.    MIZUGAKI by DECISION.
<h2>Steve Cantwell vs. Riki Fukuda</h2>
Cantwell is fighting for his UFC job having lost four in a row. And unless you have a red mohawk, you can't lose four in a row and still keep your job. Cantwell was once the WEC light heavy weight champ but the luster has faded since coming to the UFC. He's only 25 and has a lot of toughness, often fighting through broken noses, cuts, etc. Fukuda however is not the fight Cantwell should haven taken to preserve his employment. Look for Fukuda to plant Cantwell on his butt and keep him there.  FUKUDA by DECISION.

&nbsp;
<h2>Vaughan Lee vs. Norifumi "Kid" Yamamoto</h2>
I'm going to overthink this one too much. Kid really needs a win here and fighting at home should boost his game enough to get it. Vaughan Lee and his crafty jits skills I don't think can help him against a fighter who is famous for avoiding submissions.  KID by DECISION.
<h2>Takanori Gomi vs. Eiji Mitsuoka</h2>
Oh where or where has the real Gomi gone?  Maybe he was in Japan the whole time and the fighter we've seen stumble against Nate Diaz, Clay Guida, and Kenny Florian was his American-based doppelganger. Gomi has been suspectible to submission artists, and Mitsuoka certainly qualifies in that category. Even though he has victories over the likes of Rodrigo Damm, Gleison Tibau, and Joachim Hansen, a debut in the UFC against Gomi might just prove too much of a step up.   GOMI by TKO.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Main Card (PPV)</span>
<h2>Joe Lauzon vs. Anthony Pettis</h2>
Super competitive bout and my early favorite for Fight of the Night. Like the main event, I've played this out a few different ways and my brain is in overdrive debating this quandary. Lauzon has a significant amount of steam taking out the Guillard Train, and a win over Showtime would propel him to a top tier lightweight (Gray Maynard, Clay Guida, Nate Diaz?) but I just don't think he has the smothersome wrestling to keep Pettis down. Unless Lauzon has really upped his physical tool kit, I think Pettis can hang with him on the ground and keep battering him with kicks to score enough points.  Extremely tough fight to call, but hey, I gotta pick someone.  SHOWTIME by LATE SUBMISSION or DECISION.
<h2>Hatsu Hioki and Bart Palaszewski</h2>
Paalski..Plazas...Plasma.. uhh.. Bart has won five of his past six fights after getting worked by Anthony Njokuani back in '09. He christened his first UFC fight with a knockout of Tyson Griffin and I think he'll add to that momentum with a win over Hioki, whose record looks inflated from a lack of consistent good opponents.  He's going to have to watch the late round flurries that might sway the scores, but I expect Bartimus to reign supreme in the modern Colosseum.      PALASZEWSKI by DECISION.
<h2>Tim Boetsch vs. Yushin Okami</h2>
Okami's loss to Anderson Silva will only help him in the long run and I think the new attitude he's bringing to his fights are gonna pay off here against the Barbarian. Boetsch just doesn't have the dynamism to outshine Okami here, and especially not in Tokyo.   OKAMI by DECISION.
<h2>Yoshihiro Akiyama vs. Jake Shields</h2>
If Chris Leben can submit Akiyama, I can only imagine what Jake Shields can do. Although I do like this weight class for Akiyama, Shields should be able to weather the leather Sexyama is gonna hurl and get this thing down to the ground.  Due to the untimely passing of his father, I'm chalking the last fight against Ellenberger as a fluke. Moving forward, I see Akiyama as a top ten welterweight, but Shields will not falter here against that handsome bastard.   SHIELDS by SUBMISSION.
<h2>Cheick Kongo vs. Mark Hunt</h2>
Kongo knows that Hunt wants this to be a slug fest, and as he found out when he met Pat Barry awhile back (or Mir before that), Kongo is prone to getting his bell rung. Even with a good striking game of his own, Kongo should take this down. Maybe throw some of those vicious kicks early on, but eventually get Hunt down and get your paycheck.  KONGO by DECISION.
<h2>Ryan Bader vs. Quinton "Rampage" Jackson</h2>
Bader looked great in his last fight against Jason Brilz, catching him behind the ear with a huge right hook. And unless you count his misstep against Tito, and getting Jon Jonesed by.. well, Jon Jones, Bader has looked great. Huge power + Power wrestling = Safe Bet.  But I don't see how Rampage could do anything but win this fight. Even if Rampage is killed in the Octagon, I still think he'd win this fight by, I dunno.. Ghost Bomb.  Sure, 'Page could get caught with one of those big punches or taken down and kept there for 2 outta 3 rounds, but I just don't see it actually playing out that way.    RAMPAGE by KO.

&nbsp;
<h2>Champ FRANKIE EDGAR vs. BEN HENDERSON   (for the lightweight championship)</h2>
Boy, I've gone a thousand different ways on this one and am still tearing myself up over it. First off, I LOVE Frankie Edgar. Anybody who can beat BJ Penn twice (when BJ was infallible as a lightweight) and then come back from the abyss against Gray Maynard twice, to not only win but knockout a previously totally-conscious fighter is somebody you can't bet against. The guy's got heart, grit, durability, good footwork, crisp boxing, and a stud wrestling background.  Yet, sooner or later someone is going to beat him. This isn't boxing where you can tally up 50 fights against chumps without a single blemish. That blemish is going to be Ben Henderson. I hate to type it, but I can't see how Edgar beats him. It took the kick heard round the world to thwart Henderson, and I just don't think Edgar has something like that in his bag of tricks.  This hurts.. it hurts bad.. but,   HENDERSON by SUBMISSION.

<h2>LAST CARD RESULTS</h2>
4-3.  Still haven't learned how to correctly predict a Stefan Struve fight...
