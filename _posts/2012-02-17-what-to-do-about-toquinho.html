Rousimar Palhares, aka Toquino (little tree stump) is one of the most puzzling fighters in the UFC. We've seen him execute some dazzling jiu jitsu, withstand 3 rounds with Dan Henderson, and walk into the Octagon clad in a shroud of terror not many other fighters possess.

We have also seen the other side of Palhares: The one who stopped fighting in the middle of a round to point out to the referee supposed "grease" on Nate Marquardt's leg. The one who knocked Dan Miller down then jumped on top of the cage in premature victory (a move that should have disqualified him immediately). The one who holds onto that ghastly heel hook a wee too long.   And the one who does stuff like this:

This video highlights a couple things...

1. The stopping control of Palhares. He frequently holds on longer than he should, and in the first submission around the 2:07 mark, he sounds like there's a number of verbal taps "STOP STOP STOP". His restraint, is at best, questionable, and at worst, contrary to the ethics of jiu jitsu.

2. The bizarre mentality of Palhares, where immediately after standing up, engages his opponent in a bizarre grapple - which later he tries to pawn off as being some type of hug.  Seriously?  He slams his hand down on the back of the guy's neck and that's supposed to be a hug?  I'm avoiding doing anything nice for this guy if that's how he hugs.

3. Lastly, the viciousness. Ideally, this is what elevates him to the top tier of fighters. That killer instinct. To see a leg and jump on it like a starving dingo. But without the control, he's a liability. And as we've seen in fights with Tomasz Drwal, he could come seriously close to ruining an opponent's career.
Is he really worth it?  Does what he bring to the table in submissions tantamount to the riskiness he also brings with him?   I, for one, am waiting nervously for that one fight in the near future where it becomes all too evident that the warning signs went unheeded.
