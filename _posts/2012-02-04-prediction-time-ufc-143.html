MAIN CARD (Pay-per-view)
<h2>CARLOS CONDIT vs. NICK DIAZ for the Welterweight Interim Title</h2>
Call me crazy, but I think Carlos Condit had a better chance against GSP than he does against Diaz. Wait, hear me out!  Diaz is not getting subbed by Condit. Can we get that outta the way right now? Even with the Yoda of MMA Greg Jackson as his coach, the jitsu game is even, or slightly in Diaz's favor. I don't think Condit has the wrestling to overpower Diaz and control the fight. Finally, one would argue that the KO's of Dan Hardy and Stungun Kim have showcased the power and precision of Condit's striking. Simply though people, Nick Diaz is unlike any other fighter. Flush shots from Paul Daley could not put him out, I don't think it's going to happen with Condit. Plus, as a five round affair the advantage edges toward the triathelete and I think that's exactly where the fight will end up. Diaz will use that "oh my God, there's no way that can be effective but holy hell it is" style of boxing to batter Condit round in and round out.  Fans get blessed with the highly anticpiated GSP-DIAZ fight later this year.     DIAZ by late TKO

<h2>Roy Nelson vs. Fabricio Werdum</h2>
Toughest fight of the card for me to call. Roy "I belong as a bad guy character in Red Dead Redemption" Nelson has shown a chin of friggin adamantium and some thunderous punching power and while I can't see where Fabricio Werdum can beat him, I have to side with the Brazilian on this one. I have the uppercut knockout of Werdum by Junior Dos Santos burned into my brain and it may be quick to foresee Big Country having luck with the same punch, however Werdum spent his time away from the Octagon wisely and I think even taking into account the lackadaisical bout with Overeem recently, Werdum will find a way to win.  WERDUM by DECISION

&nbsp;
<h2>Josh Koscheck vs. Mike Pierce</h2>
Back in the day, Koscheck got dealt an opponent he thought was beneath him, or unworthy. In that one, Paulo Thiago ended up "SWAT"ting Koshcheck onto Queer Street en route to a surprising victory. While Pierce possesses strong wrestling and good power on the inside, Koscheck is on another level and has been weathered against the elite of the division.   KOSCHECK by DECISION or late TKO

&nbsp;
<h2>Renan Barão vs. Scott Jorgensen</h2>
Barão lost his very first professional fight back in 2005.  He hasn't lost since, spanning 28 fights. I really don't think Jorgensen is the guy who can break that streak, even though I admire his heart. Expect this one to go to be a scrambly, high paced affair but I don't see the Brazilian losing.   BARAO by DECISION

&nbsp;
<h2>Ed Herman vs. Clifford Starks</h2>
Herman went nearly two years between fights after suffering a knee injury in his hometown throwdown with Aaron Simpson at UFC 102 in Portland. The time was well spent as we've seen Herman shown some nice power and slick jits in his last two fights. Starks is built like a brick shit-house but I think Herman has trained with bigger and stronger guys in his days with Quest and has chin for days. Herman should dictate where the fight plays out and make it three in a row.  HERMAN by SUBMISSION

PRELIMINARY CARD (FX)
<h2>Max Holloway vs. Dustin Poirier</h2>
Holloway has a huge opportunity to upset, coming in as a injury replacement for Ricardo Lamas. With four fights to his credit, the UFC had to be somewhat desperate to find an opponent for Poirier. The upset ain't happening though folks. As long as Poirier takes Holloway seriously, I'm not forecasting anything other than a beat down.   POIRIER by early TKO

&nbsp;
<h2>Jorge Lopez vs. Matt Riddle</h2>
I think Lopez is undersized for this division, and Riddle a tad oversized. Expect that to be evident as the fight progresses, and Riddle should have enough wits to keep his chin tucked.  RIDDLE by DECISION

&nbsp;
<h2>Alex Caceres vs. Edwin Figueroa</h2>
I absolutely love Figeuroa and think his scrap with Michael McDonald (the wise man has the power!) was one of the best 135 affairs since the UFC expanded with that division. I just think Caceres has seen it all before and at the 135 weight should have enough of a size advantage to keep the fight where he wants it. "Toughness. A fight is not won by one punch or kick. Either learn to endure or hire a bodyguard."  -Bruce Lee.     CACERES by DECISION

&nbsp;
<h2>Matt Brown vs. Chris Cope</h2>
Wooooooooo!   Matt Brown's likely fighting for his job here, and I don't think Cope possesses the submission game which has been Matt Brown's kryptonite. Matt goes to desperation mode and pulls this one out late.  BROWN by TKO

PRELIMINARY CARD (Facebook)
<h2>Rafael Natal vs. Michael Kuiper</h2>
Tough call on Kuiper being as I don't know much about him other than the kid (22 years old) definitely has power. Natal trains with the upper echelons of jiu jitsu guys, so I see him negating the power of the Dutchman and getting the tap. It wouldn't altogether surprise me to see Natal get knocked out, but again, I gotta go with experience for this one.    NATAL by SUBMISSION

&nbsp;
<h2>Dan Stittgen vs. Stephen Thompson</h2>
Uh boy. I hate picking between two guys making their UFC debut. Gun to my head, I like Thompson's pedigree and youth and think he can gut out a win, but I really have zero confidence having not seen either fight.   THOMPSON by SPLIT DECISION

<strong><em>LAST CARD RESULTS</em></strong>

<strong>8 - 2</strong>    <strong>
(21 - 8 on the year)</strong>

Made my money by picking underdogs Chris Weidman and Lavar Johnson. As soon as I saw George Roop hanging his chin out like that in the first 20 seconds of the fight, I wanted my pick back. Good for Cub for taking advantage of that "gift".
