If you ask me the reason that I need to do this. The reason is is that I have a friend that said you give up hope when you move down here. As I walk my dog tonight I see this kid with his pants sagging around his ankles and it just makes me angry. Makes me fear full. When you live in portland you see problems with you think you can make a difference in change those issues. It's here, all I'm present to is my own fears. And when you feel a part of yourself dying inside there's nothing worse.
