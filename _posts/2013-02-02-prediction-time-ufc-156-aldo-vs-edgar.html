Slamming picks out today.  I can't wait to see what goes down but (and this could be my downfall) I think there's some easy picks here....

We'll see.

Jose Aldo vs. Frankie Edgar - for featherweight title

This will be Aldo's toughest test yet. He fails.  EDGAR by DECISION

Rashad Evans vs. Antonio Rogerio Nogueira

Evans. All day. I reckon Nogueira could catch Evans with something similar to how he put away Diabate, but Evans has looked bad against one guy ever and his name was Lyoto Machida. He didn't even look bad in his loss to Jones.   EVANS by TKO
Alistair Overeem vs. Antonio Silva

Demolition Time.  OVEREEM by TKO

Jon Fitch vs. Demian Maia

Toughest one to call by a longshot.  Still, I gotta go Fitch.  FITCH by DECISION
Joseph Benavidez vs. Ian McCall

Benavidez all day. Sorry Uncle Creepy Fans.   BENAVIDEZ by LATE TKO OR DECISION

&nbsp;

<strong>PRELIMINARY</strong>

Evan Dunham vs. Gleison Tibau

Tough one, but let's stay with Dunham after a week of flip flopping.  DUNHAM by DECISION

Jay Hieron vs. Tyron Woodley

Woodley is too good with his wrestling.  WOODLEY by close DECISION.
Bobby Green vs. Jacob Volkmann

Volkmann unless he puts his foot in his own mouth.  VOLKMANN
Yves Edwards vs. Isaac Vallie-Flagg

Yves. Come on...   EDWARDS by SUBMISSION
Chico Camus vs. Dustin Kimura

Kimura came in overweight.  I think this is the one time it pays off.  KIMURA by KIMURA?
Edwin Figueroa vs. Francisco Rivera

Battle of the Faux-Hawks.  I like Rivera here despite the minus in experience.

&nbsp;

last card results 7-4

on the year   13-9
