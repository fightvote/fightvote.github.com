Well lads, Benson Henderson is your new lightweight champion. After Sherk, Penn, and Edgar, you can now carve  the name Henderson into the Champion's Cup (which of course is the mystical grail that exists in Dana White's Las Vegas office).   Close fights seem to be par for the course in title fights for this division, and this certainly kept with that tradition. But I just don't see how anyone could have scored the fight for Edgar. Henderson controlled the action the majority of the fight, and delivered the most damaging shots, including an up-kick that probably falls into the top ten of that particular attack (Mousasi vs Jacare  and Fitch vs Thiago Alves come to mind..).

Frankie Edgar and his new bad-ass Sagat scar from Street Fighter are going to get an immediate rematch with the champ and I guess that's what we should have expected from a guy who had nothing BUT rematches in the last two years. I don't think however that the fight was close enough to warrant an immediate rematch. This was no Machida-Shogun I. This was a well-executed fight from an extremely talented and athletic Benson Henderson, who I should mention looked like a welterweight out there. Plus, way to work those standing kimuras to get out of danger, oh I dunno, 1, 2, 3, 17 times or whatever.

Dana White pressed hard for Edgar to move down to featherweight and take on Jose "He's broken free of the cage and is rampaging through the crowd" Aldo.  While I think that fight would be a FOTY candidate, I still think Edgar should stick at lightweight. You can't take two wins against BJ and a demolition over a previously un-demolishable Gray Maynard away from the "Answer".  Also, I think Dana White's fear that consistently fighting opponents bigger than him will shorten Edgar's career is a carryover from the boxing world. In MMA, where there's a lot less than 48 minutes of head punching and I think the wear and tear against a bigger opponent (like a Gray, or like a Benson) is not as much a concern.

So long live the new King! He deserves it. I see Henderson's reign being somewhere in the two year neighborhood. Really hard to discount Edgar, though. The guy is a warrior with a heart bigger than the Grinch (the Grinch at the end of the book, not the beginning).  Here's an interesting rematch statistic for you to chew on... as of May 2010, in the 28 previous second matches between two fighters where at least one of the fights was an event headliner, the winner of the original fight has won the rematch 13 times, lost 13, and two were draws.  So basically flip a coin, Jack.
