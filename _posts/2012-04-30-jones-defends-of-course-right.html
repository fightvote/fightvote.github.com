Jones didn't get that knockout he wanted so bad, but he did negate pretty much everything Evans could throw at him.  What to say about Jones that hasn't already been typed out.   He's chinkless. Even those shots Evans was able to clip him with, backed him up, but didn't put him down. His creativity is peerless at the light heavyweight level. Henderson is the next opponent, and I can't imagine what deal with Satan will have to be made in order to forge an effective game plan.

And seriously, Rashad Evans. What are you thinking when you rock your opponent?  It's definitely not "Boy, I should pounce on this guy in case he's hurt."  It's more along the lines of "I got him! Now watch these cool moves."  Who knows how the fight would have played out had Evans opted to attack the dazed Jones, rather than swagger and strut.

Frustrating to watch.
