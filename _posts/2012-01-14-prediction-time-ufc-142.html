<strong>MAIN EVENT  - ALDO vs. MENDES</strong>

More of the same from the champ I expect. Chad Mendes has better wrestling than the only opponent who had success against Jose Aldo, Mark Hominick. However Hominck’s stand up was vastly superior, unlike the power up and wing haymaker approach often employed by Mendes. Jose should be able to see those power shots coming, kick the stuffing out of Mendes’ legs and either coast, or incensed by the cheering of the local crowd, put Mendes away by the middle of the fight.        Aldo by TKO, 3<sup>rd</sup>.

<strong>CO-MAIN EVENT     -   BELFORT vs. JOHNSON</strong>

All this week, I was preparing my reasons for why Anthony “Rumble” Johnson was going to mark UFC 142 as his coming out party as an elite middleweight. Then came the weigh-ins. Vaguely citing "medical reasons" as why he couldn't get down to 185, Rumble stopped trying at 191, received fluids to rehydrate from a doctor, and tipped the scales at 197. I wonder if there's a flu or something that caused the problems, if so, I would lean toward Belfort, but now I'm torn. Something though still has me leaning toward Rumble and an apologetic victory speech to a very hostile crowd.   Johnson by Unanimous Decision.

<strong>Mike Massenzio vs. Rousimar Palhares</strong>

I don't see Massenzio having the stopping power to deal with Palhares, despite a nice showing against Steve Cantwell in his last fight. Palhares is just too dangerous on the ground and I foresee a painful ending for Massenzio.   Palhares by Submission, Round 2,

<strong>Carlo Prater vs. Erick Silva</strong>

I don't know much about this Silva kid, but what I have seen, I like. Maybe I'm drinking the kool-aid a bit here but I foresee some flashy stand up and crisp kick-boxing will stop Prater.    Silva by TKO, Round 2.

<strong>Edson Barboza vs. Terry Etim</strong>

Etim has shown some nice standup since his long layoff, but Barboza is another level and I don't see Etim's takedowns being good enough to put Barboza in a place he doesn't want to be. A plucky effort from Etim, and I imagine he'll get in a few too. But not enough.    Barboza by lopsided Unanimous Decision.

QUICK PICKS
<ul>
	<li><strong>Sam Stout vs. Thiago Tavares</strong>
Tough call. Stout by Decision.</li>
	<li><strong>Gabriel Gonzaga vs. Ednaldo Oliveira</strong>
I just can't bank on Oliveira in his first fight, and Gonzaga's history of quality opponents has just put him in a better position going into this one. Despite Junios Dos Santos raving about his training partner Oliveira, I expect Gonzaga will get the tap in the 2nd or 3rd.      Gonzaga by Submission.</li>
	<li><strong>Yuri Alcantara vs. Michihiro Omigawa</strong>
Omigawa needs to show me something more than his last forays into the Octagon before I start picking him.   Alcantra by Split.</li>
	<li><strong>Ricardo Funch vs. Mike Pyle</strong>
Pyle by Decision or late TKO. Although, I do like Funch's new haircut.</li>
	<li><strong>Felipe Arantes vs. Antonio "Pato" Carvalho</strong>
Think I'll go with Carvalho here but the lack of fights that I've seen on these two make it a tough call.    Carvalho by Split.</li>
</ul>

Alright, that's it! Enjoy the fights! Come back to see how amazing my prognostication proved!
