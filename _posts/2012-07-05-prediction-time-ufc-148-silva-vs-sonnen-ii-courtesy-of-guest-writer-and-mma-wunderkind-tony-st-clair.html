&nbsp;
<h2>PRELIMINARY CARD
Yoislandy Izquierdo vs. Rafaello Oliveira</h2>
<div>Izquierdo can punch, but he can't defend well against top-flight grapplers. Oliveira can grapple with the best, but can fold under a barrage of strikes . Hmmm. I say Oliveira weathers the storm and and puts Izquierdo on his back.          OLIVEIRA  by SUBMISSION.</div>
<h2>John Alessio vs. Shane Roller</h2>
<div>This is a two-fer-one pay-back fight by the UFC. Both men stepped in as last minute replacements, but of the two, Alessio put on the strongest performance, giving Mark Bocek all he could handle. I'm giving this to Alessio, on strength of schedule. Shane, this is your goodbye, until the next injury replacement call; stay in shape and stay by the phone...   ALESSIO by UNANIMOUS DECISION</div>
<div></div>
<h2>Riki Fukuda vs. Constantinos Philippou</h2>
<div>At one point, Philippou was a late replacement for Fukuda's opponent at UFC 133, who was himself replaced by Jorge Rivera, who Philippou outlasted for the win. He's tough, too tough for Fukuda, and he'll take it decisively. PHILIPPOU by UNANIMOUS DECISION</div>
<h2>Fabricio Camoes vs. Melvin Guillard</h2>
<div>The UFC didn't do Melvin any favors this time around. They put him against a deadly grappler, which is Melvin's kryptonite. If Guillard can get to Camoes quickly, he can overwhelm him, but I think that Melvin is psychologically gone. CAMOES by second round SUBMISSION.</div>
<h2>Khabib Nurmagomedov vs. Gleison Tibau</h2>
<div>Khabib comes in undefeated, but that's not going to last long. Tibau will be bigger and stronger, and Khabib hasn't faced a wrestler of his caliber before. Khabib can punch, but I don't think he gets a chance to. TIBAU by UNANIMOUS DECISION</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h2>MAIN CARD</h2>
<h2>Mike Easton vs. Ivan Menjivar</h2>
Ivan Menjivar can submit most opponents, but not Mike Easton. Easton is a BB, and a hard-puncher, and can go the distance. Ivan is a part-timer who holds down another non-fighting job. We saw in Mike Russow how well that works out against top opponents. EASTON by UD.
<h2>Chad Mendes vs. Cody McKenzie</h2>
<div>Cody McKenzie is the very definition of a one-trick pony, but it's as if that trick by a pony is driving an F1 Formula race car on the Gran Prix circuit; it's that good. Unfortunately, the neck being possible proffered for the famous "McKenzie-tine" is the Chad Mendes version, and it's thick, and fast, and Chad has more muscle in his deltoids than an even SLIMMER McKenzie (who was a beanpole at a higher weight-class) has in his entire lattice-work.</div>
<div>Chad Mendes by RNC, second round.</div>
<div></div>
<h2>Dong Hyun Kim vs. Demian Maia</h2>
<div>Oh Maia, we hardly knew ya. What happened to the elite submission specialist that struck fear into the hearts of every opponent outside of Anderson Silva? Has that fighter left the building? Unfortunately, I think so. Maia fell in love with striking, and forgot to consistently implement the one thing he was better at than anybody in the game, his BJJ.</div>
<div>"Stun Gun" Kim has better hands and strong wrestling, but he CAN gas. The longer the fight goes, the better for Demian, but I don't think it goes that long.                        KIM by second round KO</div>
<div></div>
<h2>Patrick Cote vs. Cung Le</h2>
<div>Someone forgot to tell both of these men they were through as top-level fighters. Cung Le was destroyed by Wanderlei Silva his last time out, and Cote was drummed out of the UFC after three straight losses. But Cote never embarrassed himself, and he's fought from hill and dale, US to Brazil, to earn another shot at the big show, and he also doesn't have a direct-to-DVD career to fall back on like Le. He wants it more, and he'll get it.            COTE by 3rd round TKO</div>
<h2>Forrest Griffin vs. Tito Ortiz</h2>
<div></div>
<div>This was a gift for Tito. A name opponent, who is not known for heavy hands, and a barely-winnable match opportunity. Really, not much more that he could ask for. But the Huntington Beach Bad Boy is going to get outworked by Forrest, who is fresher, faster, hits harder and looking towards solidifying his own legacy. Two HOF's go at it for the crowds' pleasure; Are you not entertained?                 GRIFFIN by SPLIT DECISION</div>
<div></div>
<h2>Champ Anderson Silva vs. Chael Sonnen (for middleweight title)</h2>
<div>I sat down and re-watched the first fight between these two at UFC 117. There were some stark realizations: Chael Sonnen fought the perfect fight to beat Anderson Silva, and came within a whisker of doing it, and also that he has almost no chance to do it again.</div>
<div>Let's throw out the controversial intangibles. Sonnen was super-charged to the gills on testosterone (four times the allowed limit) and Silva's ribs were either hurt during or before the fight. I'm going with the latter, considering that Sonnen has marshmallows for hands, and Silva didn't show his usual spring in his defensive movement. In either case, both of those factors shouldn't be at issue this time around.</div>
<div>So what are we left with? Usually, in a re-match, the loser makes the adjustments. The key to victory was a failure, and a re-tooling of strategy is in order. However, in this case, there is nowhere for Sonnen to adjust. His striking will never come close to parity with Silva, his submission defense may have gotten better in two years, but that's not where this fight will go, and Silva knows exactly what went wrong last time, and will switch up his approach.</div>
<div>Anderson hurt Sonnen in the fourth last time, but by that point, hurting and exhausted, he had no firepower left to finish the kill. Sonnen, always in great shape AND with the testosterone of a Charolais Bull coursing through his system, rode it out and got back on top again. That's not going to happen this time.</div>
<div>Silva knows he can hurt the iron-chinned Sonnen. He knows Chael can't hurt him with his striking (though he was momentarily stunned in the first by a looping punch; I think the shock of even being tagged by Chael was more surprising to him) and so we'll see a another Dan Henderson type-match this go-round. Anderson will utilize spacing, safe-from-takedown low kicks, and straight-up boxing technique.</div>
<div></div>
<div>SILVA retains his crown, by TKO in the second round.</div>
