The UFC recently unveiled its new opening montage - something I think they will do exclusively for PPV events. Perhaps FOX will get to use it too, but it didn't appear on UFC on FUEL.

It's a phenomenal collage befitting the legacy of the sport.

Aside from the music by Hans Zimmer (composer of <em>The Dark Knight</em>, the <em>Pirates</em> movies,<em> Inception</em>, the friggin <em>LION KING</em>, <em>Gladiator</em>, etc) which probably cost a mint, the integration of classic moments into the animation is done well, culminating in banners of different countries (representing the global ambitions of the UFC) and images of the two headlining fighters at the end.

Plus we see the following fighters getting whupped up on.

Ken Shamrock
Frank Trigg
Sean Sherk
Tim Sylvia
Tito Ortiz
Gilbert Yvel

Not exactly favorites of the organization...
