<h1>UFC 139  MAIN EVENT   HENDERSON VS. SHOGUN</h1>
November 19, 2011

This fight wasn’t supposed to be THAT good, was it? What began as the often used pitch of “two legends finally pitted against one”, or “the fight blah blah years in the making” became something special, something rarely witnessed. Without a belt on the line, it lacked the luster and hype of a title fight but as your fight loving grandpappy would say, “they just don’t make fights like this anymore”. And a throwback it was, two former legends of PRIDE, doing their best for one night to resurrect their old company, and the glory of their championship days in Japan. This was perhaps... (pause for dramatic effect) The.Greatest.Fight.Of.All.Time.

Surely no one could have foreseen that. Or wait… maybe they could have? Look at who we were dealing with after all. Dan Henderson, in the last few years of a laudable career, on a blitzkrieg of demolition over his last few fights (Babalu, Calvacante, Fedor) surely was seen as a legitimate title contender but the younger, quicker Shogun was coming off an August KO of Forrest Griffin. Both fighters had shown weakness of late, Henderson gassing and unable to get off his back against Jake Shields in April 2010 and Shogun meeting the buzz saw that is Jon Jones in March of 2011. What transpired tonight however was two men without weakness, two men without surrender. Shogun endured a litany of power shots that could kill livestock, only to rally in the late stages and again expose Henderson’s gas tank. To be fair, there isn’t a fighter alive that can throw the volume of power shots Henderson did and not fatigue. Shogun, in zombie mode, somehow channeled enough energy to not only win rounds four and five, but do so convincingly, more than once pinning Henderson in full mount to rain down punches. It was Rocky-Apollo II, all it needed was ref Josh Rosenthal counting to ten in slow motion as both fighters strived to get to their feet. Much like Rocky I however, both battered fighters went from the cage directly to the hospital.

The UFC has promoted thousands of fights. Some play out like the hallowed Griffin-Bonnar 1, Anderson Silva-Chael Sonnen, or Edgar-Maynard III. Others lapse into the Khalib Starnes vs. Nate Quarry (hysterical to revisit that one), Tim Sylvia vs. Andrei Arlovski III (zzzzzz), and Anderson Silva vs. Thales Leites world (title fight to forget). Henderson vs. Shogun is now the benchmark. It’s the ultimate. Its greatness is unattainable, but I hope some fighters in the future aspire to try.
