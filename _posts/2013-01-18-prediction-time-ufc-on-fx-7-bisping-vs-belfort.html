We're back to Brazil so pack your kevlar and bullet proof glass!  Just kidding (not really).
<h2><strong>Main Card Bouts:</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>
-</strong>Vitor Belfort (21-10) vs. Michael Bisping (23-4)</h2>
<strong></strong>A Bisping fight, my Achilles heel.  Ok, two scenarios here. Belfort knocks Bisping loopy or Bisping sticks and moves and overwhelms a depleted Belfort (whose weight cut won't gel with a 5 round fight) and pulls out a late TKO or decision. Are we all in agreement on that? Last time Bisping got KO'd was in 2009. Belfort has looked... welll.. hard to say. He took a beating by Anthony Johnson for a couple minutes. Jon Jones put the hurt on him, like he does everyone else, and Anderson famously introduced his foot to Vitor's face.  I really don't think Belfort's jiu jitsu will play a part here as Bisping is tremendous at getting to this feet. I think he's learned from the Henderson lost to stay away from the big shots, and on top of that he has more to gain by the win.  I'm going to throw up but... BISPING by DECISION
<h2><strong>
-</strong>Daniel Sarafian (7-2) vs. CB Dollaway (12-4)<strong></strong></h2>
Sarafian's got a lot of Brazilian hype behind him but Clarence Byron just decisioned Mayhem Miller.  Uh, right..  SARAFIAN by any way he wants.<strong>
</strong>
<h2>-Gabriel Gonzaga (13-6) vs.<strong> </strong>Ben Rothwell (32-8)</h2>
Rothwell has alternated wins and losses over his last 6 fights and if that trend continues he stands to lose this one. That said, Gonzaga hasn't really faced the top tier competition his last few fights that Rothwell has. I think he still has a chance to flash that talent that crumpled Cro Cop but Rothwell is gonna win this one. ROTHWELL by TKO.<strong>
</strong>
<h2><strong>-</strong>Thiago Tavares (17-4-1) vs. Khabib Nurmagomedov (18-0)</h2>
Strange to put this one on the main card but I guess you gotta do what ya gotta do and Tavares is Brazilian.. so can he take the 0 from Khabib? I don't think so. Despite Khabib only having a couple of fights in the UFC, he bested the biggest of lightweights in Gleison Tibau so I know he has the strength to handle Tavares. It should be a good scrap but I think the Russian comes out on top.  NURMAGOMEDOV by PERESTROIKA DECISION
<h2><strong>Preliminary Bouts:</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>
-</strong>Godofredo Pepey Castro<strong></strong> (8-1) vs. Milton Vieira (13-7-2)<strong></strong></h2>
Stay off the ground Pepey. Vieira is a beast in the jits world, has a 2nd degree black belt and the rumors are he invented the anaconda choke. Whoa.  That said his record is in need of some more wins and I don't think Pepey is stupid. PEPEY by close DECISION.<strong>
</strong>
<h2><strong>-</strong>Ronny Markes (13-1) vs.<strong> </strong>Andrew Craig (8-0)<strong></strong></h2>
Intriguing matchup here and hats off to Joe Silva for putting it together. Until he shows me he can lose, I expect Craig's talent/luck to continue holding out.  Maybe he gets some top tier guy after this who can bust up the undefeated.  CRAIG by Whothehellknows
<h2><strong>-</strong>Diego Nunes (18-3) vs.<strong> </strong>Nik Lentz (22-5-2)<strong></strong></h2>
Lentz does one thing good and he's gonna do it to Nunes all day long.  LENTZ by DECISION
<h2><strong>-</strong>Edson Barboza (10-1) vs. Lucas Martins (12-0)</h2>
Plenty of undefeated dudes on this card. Let's hope Barboza has learned from his mistakes with Varner. BARBOZA by TKO.
<h2>-Yuri Alcantara (28-4) vs. Pedro Nobre (14-1-2)</h2>
Alcantara is another one of those tricky guys that's hard to pin down. I thought he had it against Hacran Dias and I was wrong. I think he's going to fare better against the UFC newcomer, even if this is Yuri's first go at 135.  ALCANTARA by SUBMISSION
<h2>-Wagner Prado (8-1) vs. Ildemar Alcantara (17-5)</h2>
<strong><strong></strong></strong>Let's see that Wagner Prado we were promised. No eye pokes, guys.  PRADO by TKO
<strong></strong>
<h2>-Francisco Trinaldo (11-2) vs. CJ Keith (8-1)</h2>
I can't believe Trinaldo fights at lightweight. He's going to bully Keith and take his lunch money. And a W.  TRINALDO by TKO.

<h2></h2>
<h2>Last Card Results 1-5   (lest not speak of it again!)</h2>
<h2>2012 Totals:  152- 109    That means I was right....   58.2 percent of the time.   Not great, but enough to win money.</h2>
