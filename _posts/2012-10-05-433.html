Hey, we're back! Technical issues prevented us from posting the last fight car predictions, but I assure you, I got 'em all right. Cool! Moving on! We journey to Minneapolis for a Friday Night Fight! Hope you don't have a high school football game that would take precedence over the fights.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Main Card:</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>
</strong>Travis Browne vs. Antonio “Bigfoot” Silva</h2>
Silva has a win over Fedor. Not a ton of people can say that. He's also very good at using his weight and power to donkey kong opponents into the mat. His jits game is also pretty sexy for a guy of his size. That said, at the heavy weight division speed kills and Browne has speed in spades. Look for Hapa to use his reach, change distances and continually give Bigfoot something new to think about. Knowing Silva's durability, it's gonna be hard to finish him, but Browne should walk with the W.   BROWNE by UNANIMOUS DECISION
<h2>Jake Ellenberger vs. Jay Hieron</h2>
Interesting clash here as Hieron owns a win over Ellenberger, but hasn't been a UFC employee since 2005 when he took a loss due to cuts to Jonathon Goulet. These two were expected to fight at the UFC 151: Phantom Menace, or "The Card that Should Not be Named". Those extra weeks of prep time should help Hieron here, but I don't know if it's gonna be enough. Ellenberger was knocking at the welterweight door for some time before Kampmann kneed the hell outta him. Knowing he needs something impressive here to right the ship, I expect the Juggernaut to throw early and often and I imagine Hieron knows it. I think Hieron makes it close, and he would be a sentimental pick on my behalf, but Ellenberger should be able to finish it late.   ELLENBERGER by TKO
<h2>John Dodson vs. Jussier “Formiga” da Silva</h2>
So Jussier da Silva is supposed be the next big thing outta Brazil. The next big "Silva" if you will. Granted he's looked impressive in the black market dvds I've been able to secure of his fights, but this is the UFC and not only is the trip gonna take it's toll, the Target Center lights can have a nauseating effect, I mean hell, look at the Timberwolves. Dodson is fast as any 125'er and I expect a fast (yet calculated) plan of attack of takedowns and smotherings.     DODSON by UNANIMOUS DECISION
<h2>Justin Edwards vs. Josh Neer</h2>
Maybe Joe Silva knows something I don't (impossible!) but this looks like, dare I say, a lock for Josh Neer. Edwards doesn't have the experience, the quality of opponents, nor the bag of tricks to grit out a win here. Neer's great off his back and despite being k.o.'d in his last go-around, I'd say he can outstrike Edwards.  NEER by SUBMISSION
<h2>Preliminary Card:</h2>
<h2>Jeremy Stephens (20-8) vs. Yves Edwards (41-18-1)</h2>
Not sure this fight will happen. But if it does, I think Stephens's LunchBox Hands will eventually find Yves's chin. Would love to see Edwards resurrect his career here a la Jamie Varner's win over Barboza, but the smart money would have to be on Stephens. Provided he's not taking a Con Air flight back to Iowa...    STEPHENS by KO
<h2>Michael Johnson (11-6) vs. Danny Castillo (14-4)</h2>
I've picked against Johnson a couple of times and been wrong. Castillo and basically any Alpha Male Team member are gonna give you a heavy dose of wrestling. Johnson's game is a bit more versatile, and he looked great over Tony Ferguson last time up. I see him keeping the magic going.  JOHNSON by SPLIT DECISION
<h2>Jacob Volkmann vs. Shane Roller</h2>
Volkmann is fighting at home, but Roller is liking fighting for his job. Both these guys have good wrestling games while Roller seems to have more dynamite in his fists. It won't be pretty but I expect Volkmann to pull it off using his tried and true wrestle / grind/ fence press gameplan and then attempt to be funny in his post fight interview.  VOLKMANN by DECISION
<h2>Bart Palaszewski vs. Diego Nunes</h2>
I like Nunes here to pull off the slight upset. Nunes got dealt Siver and Florian in his last two losses, and I don't think Bart is on that level. Perhaps the Pole gets Nunes in a bad spot and can slap on a submission, but I'd like to think Nunes's purple belt will bail him out. NUNES by DECISION
<h2>Darren Uyenoyama vs. Phil Harris</h2>
Don't know much about Phil Harris who is an injury replacement fill-in. So was Tito Ortiz once upon a time. Could this be another Tito? No. But still, you don't get a record of 21-9 doing nothing with your time. Still Uyenoyama is probably in the better position to win and it's not his first rodeo.  REALLY HARD JAPANESE NAME via SUBMISSION
<h2>Carlo Prater vs. Marcus LeVesseur</h2>
We're gonna find out that one of these guys doesn't belong in the UFC. We might find out in a couple months that both don't, but for the time being. LeVesseur got caught in a McKenzietine his last fight, and he's probably still kicking himself because of it. Lesson learned. LEVESSEUR by DECISION<strong></strong>
<h2><strong></strong>
Aaron Simpson (12-3) vs. Mike Pierce (14-5)</h2>
A tough fight for both guys here. Damned if you do, damned if you don't with who you pick here - you're most likely gonna be wrong. Simpson is still somewhat new to the welterweight division and Pierce is probably still bummed over losing the split decision to Koschek in February. Coin flip of a fight, but I'll go with the bigger guy.  SIMPSON by SPLIT DECISION
