"OHHHHH, CANADA! Our home and native land!"
So here we go Calgary, you got a title fight. Kind of...
Enjoy!

PRELIMINARY CARD
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Mitch Clarke vs. Anton Kuivanen</h2>
</li>
</ul>
I like Kuivanen's experience here, but Canadian fighters are different when they're at home.  CLARKE by SUBMISSION
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Antonio Carvalho vs. Daniel Pineda</h2>
</li>
</ul>
Pineda looked just ok in his match with Mike Brown, but Carvalho has yet to put together a good MMA streak despite his training (the guy is swimming in high ranked belts in multiple art forms). Let's go Pineda here, he's younger and hungrier.   PINEDA by DECISION
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Bryan Caraway vs. Mitch Gagnon</h2>
</li>
</ul>
Gagnon is some submission whiz kid who was supposed to fight Johnny Bedford before Visa issues kept him in Canada. Maybe he can whip out a sub against Caraway who trains outta Team Alpha Male. Those guys however are pretty good at using their wrestling to negate jiu jitsu, perhaps at the expense of an exciting fight. Wouldn't be surprised to see some crazy Gagnonoplata but the smart money is on Caraway.    CARAWAY by DECISION
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Ryan Jimmo vs. Anthony Perosh</h2>
</li>
</ul>
I think the fairy tale run of the 40 year old Perosh gets a dose of reality as he runs into Jimmo and some serious karate. To be fair,  Perosh could get the take down and sink in a choke and except for the home turf that's where I would lay my coin. But Jimmo is gonna have 15000 faithful in his corner. It matters. JIMMO by DECISION
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Roland Delorme vs. Francisco Rivera</h2>
</li>
</ul>
A close fight on paper. Delmorme's got one or two shots at this through this submission game. Rivera could throw and hope to catch Delorme going for the takedown. I'm not sold on Delorme's chin, but I think jits perseveres here late. DELORME by SUBMISSION
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Court McGee vs. Nick Ring</h2>
</li>
</ul>
Another close fight, as both of these guys are skilled in all facets. McGee has lost some luster off this Ultimate Fighter Winner trophy and could use a big KO or submission to rocket him up the ladder. Ring is kinda in the same boat and both guys are just languishing in that tepid pool of card-fillers. I'm really hoping one of these reads this and puts on a show.  Can Ring continue the momentum of his recent crime-fighting heroics?  I think so.   RING by DECISION

MAIN CARD
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Chris Clements vs. Matt Riddle</h2>
</li>
</ul>
I'm surprised a little bit this fight made it to the main card. Neither of these guys have done anything to really put themselves on a PPV main card. Riddle's been somewhat lucky in his wins and although I'm not sold on Clements yet, I'm certainly not backing Riddle quite yet.  CLEMENTS by TKO
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Brian Ebersole vs. James Head</h2>
</li>
</ul>
I don't know how Ebersole keeps  winning fights. He's the Anthony Perosh of the welterweight division.  He's coming off a short rest and before he makes his supposed drop to the lightweight division he meets Head who took out overhyped Papi Abedi in his last go around. Ebersole has over 45,000 fights or something and I don't think Head can bring anything Ebersole hasn't seen. Unless he just goes out there and lollygags to give himself fodder to DO go ahead and make the lightweight move (I know, crazy..), he should wrest the victory here.   EBERSOLE by CHEST HAIR STYLZE DEMOLITION
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Shawn Jordan vs. Cheick Kongo</h2>
</li>
</ul>
Everybody is super high on Jordan and super low on Kongo here. I realize Kongo has had a string of bad luck recently, but he's still Cheick Kongo, and Cheick Kongo has made a good living on beating people that look exactly like Shawn Jordan. I don't know how to explain that any more. I'm sorry. But hey, Kongo's gonna pull this one out and then make the Championship Belt pantomime that Packers QB Aaron Rodgers blatantly stole. Yes, he totally did.   KONGO by DECISION
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Tim Boetsch vs. Hector Lombard</h2>
</li>
</ul>
Uh boy. hard one here. Hector "Can Crushing" Lombard in his first UFC fight against Tim "I will not be denied against Okami no matter what" Boetsch. I think the general populous is anointing Lombard as the heir apparent to the middleweight throne, or at least the title fight. People are quick to dismiss Boetsch's PERFECT middleweight record. Ok, fair enough. It's only 3-0, but not many people have FINISHED Okami. Lombard has the judo skills to either throw Boetsch down or keep himself upright. And I doubt the Barbarian is gonna execute a submission at any point in the near future.  The ONLY way Timmy is gonna pull this out is if we go to deep water and the muscle bound Lombard starts gasping for breath or burns himself out throwing hurting bombs.  It COULD happen. And often times the dude coming into the UFC gets derailed by the bright light. But no, not this time. LOMBARD by CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS KO
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Urijah Faber vs. Renan Barao (for interim bantamweight title)</h2>
</li>
</ul>
The groundwork has been set on how to beat Urijah Faber (kick the shit outta his Alpha Male legs or Cruzify him). It's a lot harder to come up with a gameplan for Renan Barao. "Take him to deep waters" is usually the go-to response. And we all know Faber's got a gas tank from an airline freighter. Also you have to look at the spotlight this fight is receiving. Faber's been here all before. Maybe not on the UFC level as much, but certainly as Lord Kingpin in the WEC Faber handled big pressure fights constantly. Barao not so much. Barao also had some pretty terrible competition during his 30 fight win streak whereas Faber's consistently faced the top at 145 and 135. That said, 30 wins is insane at any level and I expect tiny Fedor here to find a way to beat Faber.  BARAO by DECISION

Last card results:  7 - 4       (Thanks a lot Andrew Craig you comeback bastard for depriving me of my 8-3!)

On the year:  109 - 75
