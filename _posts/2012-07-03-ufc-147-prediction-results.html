6 - 4  on the night.

Correct picks:   Franklin, Mutante, Werdum, Wolverine, Perpetuo, Damm.

Incorrect picks:

Pepey over Rony Jason.   Good for Jason.

Pe de Chumbo over. Massaranduba.  Thought Massaranduba's conditioning was gonna be more of a problem. Guess it doesn't matter when you can hit like that.

Galeto over Vina.  Vina with a massive comeback. No shame in that.

Alcantara over Dias.   Kind of a boring fight, but Dias did a great job under such a heavy spotlight.

&nbsp;

There was a draw too so I guess that's a push.
