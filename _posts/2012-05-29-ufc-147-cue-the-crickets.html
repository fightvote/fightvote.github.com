Dana White and the UFC are going to have to work triple overtime to pull this card together. Don't be surprised if you see fights from UFC 148 being transferred on over.  Fighters who THINK they're fighting in July or August may get the call this weekend that their training camp has now been halved. But when the boss calls ya, you better answer. So far though, it looks like tumbleweeds are blowing through this card.
