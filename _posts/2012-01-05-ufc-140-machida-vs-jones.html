December 10, 2011

And the kid just continues to impress. Jon Jones, all of twenty four years, has accomplished a lot in his short career. However, on Saturday he did what no UFC light heavy weight has been able to do since the days of Chuck Liddell. Defend the belt with any conviction. Rampage defended it once. Forrest couldn’t. Rashad couldn’t. Machida defended it once in the controversial first Shogun fight. And Shogun couldn’t defend the belt himself. But now here comes Bones. Two defenses. Two finishes. And the kid can’t even rent a car legally. Good grief…

This was Kasparov vs. Deep Blue. Sherlock vs. Moriarty. Solid Snake vs. Liquid. The chess match of Machida’s stylistic enigma vs. Jones’ raw talent and unparalleled length. And for the first round and a half it really seemed that Jones had met his match. He got hit. He was wobbled. He looked… beatable? The fans chanted Machida’s name. The press leaned forward in their seats, eager to see if this fight could somehow trump UFC 139’s sensational Shogun vs. Henderson. But then a takedown and an elbow forged from diamond turned the tide toward the young champion. Machida’s blood spilled into his eye and although a doctor gave the green light to continue, the gash looked grotesque. Machida would need to accelerate this fight in order to stave off a ref stoppage. A few seconds later it didn’t matter, as Jones delivered a mean left hand, dropping Machida and securing a guillotine choke as the top fighters stood. Then that crazy height and orangutan arms paid off and Machida went to sleep.  Next!

And who is next? Or more importantly, what fighter on this planet is going to stand a chance with this guy?  Rashad Evans, Phil Davis, Alexander Gustafson?   Or maybe a true world warrior like Blanka or Guile? Hell, does anybody have Shang Tsung’s phone number?
