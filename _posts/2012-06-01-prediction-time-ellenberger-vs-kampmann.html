Lot of new blood making their Octagon debut. Do we have a future champ among us tonight? We'll see.

PRELIMINARY CARD
<h2>John Albert vs. Erik Perez</h2>
Unless Erik Perez is some phenom that the UFC knows all about (he's not) and tonight is his coming out party (it's not), this should be Albert's fight all day long.   ALBERT by TKO
<h2>Jeremy Larsen vs. Joe Proctor</h2>
Should be a good scrap. Don't know too much aside from what I saw on TUF, but Proctor looked a bit more ready for the bright lights.  PROCTOR by DECISION
<h2>Cristiano Marcello vs. Sam Sicilia</h2>
Yes, his jiu jitsu is amazing, but this aint' Abu Dhabi or the Pan Am games. SICILIA by TKO
<h2>Myles Jury vs. Chris Saunders</h2>
Loved the way Saunders fought on the show. Jury has the pedigree and the camp to rattle off a few quick UFC wins and I think he does just that.  JURY by SUBMISSION
<h2>Daron Cruickshank vs. Chris Tickle</h2>
I guess we're supposed to be excited by this because somebody got hit in the balls, and some prank was pulled, and all that other house b.s. that happened on the show.  I don't care about their "beef". Let's go with....   TICKLE by TKO

(MAIN CARD (FX)
<h2>Justin Lawrence vs. John Cofer</h2>
Not too jacked to see this one. Neither guy stood out on the show.    Could be a coin flip kinda pick.  Hopefully, Johnny is in the crowd to root for his cousin, Justin.  Anybody get that reference?  LAWRENCE by DECISION
<h2>Max Holloway vs. Pat Schilling</h2>
Babies going at it, as both Holloway and Schilling are too young to rent a car.  Both coming off loses as well.  HOLLOWAY by DECISION
<h2>Jonathan Brookins vs. Charles Oliveira</h2>
Tough call. Oliveira looked outstanding in his featherweight debut showing off a calf slicer submission. Brookins won't fall into any easy traps but I still think Oliveira can give him enough trouble.  OLIVEIRA by DECISION
<h2>Mike Chiesa vs. Al Iaquinta</h2>
Hard not to root for Chiesa after the year he's been through. However I'm a strong believer in the Serra-Longo School and it appears everything they taught Iaquinta stuck.  I like " 'lil Weidman" to walk away with the crown, but Chiesa doesn't go away easily.   IAQUINTA by late TKO
<h2>Jake Ellenberger vs. Martin Kampmann</h2>
Extremely tough call as Kampmann has shown massive chin and good takedown defense in his fights. By all accounts, he was losing against Thiago Alves before Alves served up his own neck.  Ellenberger has all the tools save for a great jits game and SHOULD win this fight. But I've counted out Kampmann before and this seems like one of those fights I'd go all in on Ellenberger and then yell at my tv.  Somehow Kampmann is gonna pull it off.    KAMPMANN by SUBMISSION
