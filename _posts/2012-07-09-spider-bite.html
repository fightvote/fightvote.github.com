You can't make mistakes against this guy. You can't make mistakes against the best fighters period, but Anderson Silva finds that mistake and exploits it for the world to see.  After round one, everybody either thought or said, "here we go again." Anderson took a lot less damage and after mistakenly going to the wrong eighth of the Octagon after Round 1, he looked composed and unfazed by losing the round.  A spinning back fist. A spinning back fist against the greatest striker in MMA history. What were you thinking, Chael? After criticizing Yushin Okami's performance for deviating from a gameplan, Sonnen came out and did the exact OPPOSITE thing he shoulda done, and the opposite thing of what was working.  And ya know what, one mistake is all it takes. And now it's back down the line. Now Chael gets the ultimate punishment; to wonder what if. What if he had just stuck to the takedown approach and not tried a ridiculously low success rate attack like a spinning back fist. But like in the first fight, Silva capitalized on the smallest mistake and won the fight.  That's what great fighters do.<em>
