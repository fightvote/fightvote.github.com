Wow, some great highlights today on the phone with the press corp and the fighters. Anderson took seemingly every opportunity to point out that he's going to beat Chael worse than anybody's been beaten in the Octagon. He's "going to break all his teeth, his arms, his legs. He won't be able to walk out of the arena."

"I'm gonna make him pay and make sure . I'm gonna beat him the way his parents should have beaten him to teach his manners."

"I'm not playing around. He's gonna have to visit a plastic surgeon after the fight."

Chael replied with two words, "Medium. Rare."

In case you don't know the back story.

Here's Chael from 2011:

"You tell Anderson Silva I'm coming over and I'm kicking down his backdoor and patting his little lady on the ass and I'm telling her to make me a steak, medium-rare just how I like it."
