So, the fans are going to get the title fight they've been clamoring for. "Suga" (not Sugar) Rashad Evans gave the young Nitany Lion a absolute schooling in professional mixed martial arts Saturday night. Evans had an answer for everything thrown his way, and even with the wrestling pedigree, unbeaten record, and lats that make him resemble a character from Mike Tyson's Punch Out, Phil Davis simply was outclassed.

Even in the situations where Davis had opportune positions (hands clasped around Evans' back, pressing Evans against the fence, or on top after a takedown) Evans was able to manuever to safety. Although the powerful punching that caught fighters like Forrest Griffin and Chuck Liddell never came, Rashad really never was in danger.

I was impressed with the kick-catching (and kick-checking!) ability of Evans, his nifty trips, and the hustle against the bigger opponent, and while we didn't have a finish that would have propelled him into the April title fight with Jon Jones with some sought after momentum, I can't really find fault with what Evans accomplished. And while I criticized Evans a bit for his string of victories over rusty, injured, or substandard opponents, Phil Davis is no joke and very well could be a future champ.

The title fight with Jones is going to be a lot closer than people think.
