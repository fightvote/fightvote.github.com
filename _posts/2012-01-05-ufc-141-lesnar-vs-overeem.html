<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">UFC 141 MAIN EVENT    ALISTAIR OVEREEM VS BROCK LESNAR</span></h3>
December 30, 2011

It was billed as the biggest UFC event of all time, and while Emmanuel Yarborough probably takes some offense hearing that, it surely looked as we were entering Thunderdome terriorty. Brock Lesnar at 6’3”, 266 (he most likely cut 10-20 pounds prior to weigh in)   and Alistair Overeem at 6’5”, 263.  That’s 520+ pounds of man meat tossing around a hopefully reinforced cage for twenty five minutes. God spare the children and immobile pets in the front row. Perhaps the cage won’t hold and the two fighters spill out into the crowd, a Tasmanian Devil blur of dust, fists, legs and heads. It wouldn’t even stop there. No, they’d pour out into the street, having broken through the walls. Cars would fishtail and semi trucks would flip as the frenzied combatants just keep on whooping each other. Kind of like Optimus Prime vs. Megatron, except without weird laser swords. In the end, one would walk slowly from the rubble, his fallen foe no more than pulp. Like the cover of a comic book, we’d finally have that image of one single man standing wearily above his nemesis. This fight would be the culmination of a big year for the UFC, and not just the size of the fighters, but the expectations must also be grandiose. Could the capstone to 2011, be a boo-barraged unanimous decision where both guys failed to engage? Where Brock held Alistair down and “lay and prayed” the night away? Or where Alistair cautiously circled, firing jabs and unenthusiastic straights, scared to pick up his legs and fire a kick less Brock shoot in like a bull in heat? And while the simple assessment of this fight (Brock needs to get this fight down to win) proved exact, it was still a fun couple of minutes.

The blitzkrieg of Brock never came and Alistair stayed on his feet. Brock was tentative with his striking to, unsure of how to navigate the high tech weapon in front of him. Brock threw two leg kicks to start the fight, something he should have been doing in spades.  The one time Brock did grab a leg, Alistair wormed out of it, perhaps Brock felt his Spidey Sense tingle on an impending knee and didn’t commit like he should have. A minute into the fight, Brock threw a lighting fast right and Alistair was cut. And a bad cut on top of it. Maybe those ham hocks Brock has could be the difference? Instead, the cut fueled a second gear of Alistair and he went to those knees that had made him famous in K-1.  We’d never seen Brock get worked over to the body before and Alistair was the man to expose it, his devastating knees forged from adamantium. Brock shuddered when they landed and suddenly we were reminded of his previous two fights (Cain Velasquez and Shane Carwin) when he had been in panic mode. The left leg kick to the body sealed Brock’s fate and the hulking man’s face contorted in pain. As if plucked from Mike Tyson’s Punch Out, Brock channeled Von Kaiser’s stunned expression and the end was near. Brock crumbled in a last defense, protecting his head and basically counting the seconds. A well placed body punch was the final punctuation mark to a pretty thrilling bout.

Looking ahead, it’s a shame Brock decided to call it quits. I think he still had a lot of potential and would have liked that Frank Mir trilogy to unfold. Back to Alexandria Brock, enjoy those Jimmy Johns. As for Alistair vs. Junior for the title, it’s salivating to think about the fisticuff demonstration possible in what will be billed as the heavyweight’s best all around striker versus the organization’s most powerful boxer. My early prediction is Junior but I’m willing to watch enough sparring footage of Reem to help sway my vote.  What has proven a banner year for the UFC has left everyone with lofty expectations for 2012 and I can’t wait to see it exceed them.
