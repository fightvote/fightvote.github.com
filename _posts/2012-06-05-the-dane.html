<a href="http://blog.fightvote.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/holger-danske.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-328" title="holger danske" src="http://blog.fightvote.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/holger-danske-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>   When you take on Martin Kampmann you better be ready to kill the guy. Kampmann once again sustained a brutalizing before coming back to snatch victory. Seriously, what more could Ellenberger have done short of strangle this guy to death. The Dane, once again, rose to his feet, his defeated opponent strewn across the canvas, and strutted around the cage, bathed in this own blood. And while looking ahead at GSP, Condit, and Jonny Hendricks as potential suitors for his immediate future, you really can't say Kampmann would be favored in any of them. However, you can also not say he's not going to be in the fight. Here's hoping he gets his ass kicked backstage next time (as is custom) so that by the time the bell rings he's tasted his own blood. I'm one of the few who picked Kampmann to defeat Ellenberger and I may do the same when the underdog is pitted against his next foe.
