I actually didn't have a problem with what Guida was doing the first couple rounds. It was obviously frustrating Maynard and probably could have paid dividends had he chose to pounce on Maynard or vary his gameplan in the later rounds. Hell, he even had a nice kick 1-2 combination that seemed to actually stagger Maynard. Yet instead he got on his bicycle and demonstrated his cardio instead of stealing what was by all accounts Maynard's fight to lose. Can't really rave about Maynard's performance either. And the shill move of invoking Arturo Gatti in the ring after the decision was blatant pandering and New Jersey fans didn't seem impressed.
