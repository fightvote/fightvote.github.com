Hey gang, had a bunch of stuff going on but dammit I'm still making my pics!

Can't do the whole card, but here's the main:

<strong>BRAD PICKETT VS. EDDIE WINELAND</strong>

Hmm. Tough. On a whim I'm gonna go Pickett. He's got the good juju in his favor and think he can out-everything the dangerous but haphazard Wineland.  PICKETT by DECISION


<strong> DEREK BRUNSON VS. CHRIS LEBEN</strong>

I know very little of Brunson other than Jacare knocked him out this summer. Ok, I guess that means he's tailor made for a Chris Leben knockout. At least that's what I think the UFC wants and is hoping for Christmas. Call me spoiler but I think this is where Leben loses. He's been away from the game for a bit (drugs, or duis, or Hawaiian walkabouts) and I don't typically back fighters with ring rust. Add to that I'm not sure where the heart is with this guy. How many "second" chances are you gonna get before you figure it out? Is this the one where he puts it all together? I don't think so.   BRUNSON by SUBMISSION

<strong> ALAN BELCHER VS. YUSHIN OKAMI</strong>

Belcher has been on an absolute tear and Okami has shown some wear. See? I rhymed. I like Belcher and although Okami is massive I expect him to be able to wriggle out of the bad spots and get enough points to move on to a Bisping/Befort/Boetsch.   BELCHER by DECISION

<strong> TIM BOETSCH VS. CONSTANTINOS PHILIPPOU</strong>

Damn, this one's gonna be fun. Philippou throws with abandon and Boetsch has seen some serious competition of late that should prepare him for that. Boetsch is big. Boetsch is bald. Boetsch is gonna take it all and come out on top.   BOETSCH by DECISION


<strong>JOE LAUZON VS. JIM MILLER</strong>

Jim Miller outwrestles his opponents. He's gonna outwrestle Jim Lauzon. It won't be enough though.  LAUZON by SUBMISSION


<strong>CHAMP JUNIOR DOS SANTOS VS. CAIN VELASQUEZ</strong>

<aside id="sidebar">Show me the weakness in Dos Santos' game.  Then I'll pick against him. Until then... IF then...        DOS SANTOS by KNOCKOUT</aside>
