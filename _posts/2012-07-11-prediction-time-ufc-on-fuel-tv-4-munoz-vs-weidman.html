Many thanks to Tony St. Clair for guest writing in my stead, and proving that even a drunk, blind, dumb bastard can occasionally beat me. (HEY TONY!)

PRELIMINARY CARD
<h2>Raphael Assuncao vs. Issei Tamura</h2>
Tamura was very impressive back in Japan in his win over Zhang Tiequan. Provided the jetlag hasn't gotten to him , I think he'll impress again over Assuncao, who's had a hard time looking consistent since coming under the Zuffa banner in 2009.   TAMURA by TKO
<h2>Marcelo Guimaraes vs. Dan Stittgen</h2>
It won't be a Wonderboy death kick, but Guimaraes should be able to finish Stittgen and send him back to the California Penal League. Say hi to Ricky Vaughn.   GUIMARAES by TKO.
<h2>Andrew Craig vs. Rafael Natal</h2>
This is a tough one to call. Craig's got a lot of talent, and gutting out a short notice win over Kyle Noke moved him up the UFC chain perhaps a bit earlier than expected. Natal has seemingly been on the verge of cracking the top 15 for what feels like ever. Down the road a few months and with at least two UFC fights to his credit, I may have backed Craig here, but instead I think Natal shows his black belt off a bit and optimizes his ground superiority. Craig's brown belt should keep him from getting subbed, but I think he's just too green.   NATAL by DECISION
<h2>Chris Cariaso vs. Josh Ferguson</h2>
If I was to bet on a fight, and I never bet on fights, because well, anything can happen, I would be on Cariaso here. He's shown great poise even in his defeats and I don't think Ferguson is ready for a fighter on Cariaso's level.      CARAIASO by TKO
<h2>Alex Caceres vs. Damacio Page</h2>
Page has lost three in a row. I think he digs deep to prevent a "Dan Hardy" (losing four in a row) and finds a way to overpower Bruce Leeroy. Without the desperation, I would be backing Caceres here who MAY be starting to figure things out a bit.  Until that time however...               PAGE by DECISION

MAIN CARD
<h2>Rafael dos Anjos vs. Anthony Njokuani</h2>
Really looking forward to this one. The fans are gonna be the true winners, but I guess in the more literal sense of the word I think that dos Anjos has the more rounded game to grab the W. Njokuani seems a little awkward on the ground but his striking is on point, especially those kicks.  Almost a coin flip situation here, but I think dos Anjos has a few more paths to victory and I think he'll saunter down one of 'em.    DOS ANJOS by DECISION
<h2>T.J. Dillashaw vs. Vaughan Lee</h2>
Vaughan Lee looked great against Yamamoto. Can he keep the dream alive against the rather inexperienced Dillashaw? Probably. However, Team Alpha Male are the kings of the lower weight classes and all being in the same gym as Benavidez and Faber has got this kid primed for almost anything.    Oh yeah, and the British can't wrestle, right?            DILLASHAW by late SUBMISSION
<h2>Francis Carmont vs. Karlos Vemola</h2>
I like Carmont and think he's got a high ceiling in the sport. But Vemola is a STOUT 185 and think he's gonna dictate the location of the fight, most likely which Carmont's back on the mat. VEMOLA by TKO
<h2>Kenny Robertson vs. Aaron Simpson</h2>
Robertson had a cup of coffee up in the majors just long enough to get KO'd by Mike Pierce. He's back in the UFC filling in for a hurt Jon Fitch after grabbing some wins in the minors. Simpson finally cut to 170 (who isn't dropping weight classes these days?) and it's long overdue.  The fight is gonna be closer than it looks on paper. I think Simpson guts it out, but Robertson gets another UFC fight for his efforts.    SIMPSON by DECISION
<h2>Joey Beltran vs. James Te Huna</h2>
Beltran's FINALLY at 205 and he looked great at the weigh ins. I love Beltran and think he's a throwback to the mid 90s of the UFC in terms of a guy who goes out and throws power bombs all fight long. The only problem is Te Huna who's striking as been menacing his last two fights, and is used to the 205 weight cut. Plus he's got the wrestling to keep Beltran guessing. And guess Beltran will.            TE HUNA by DECISION
<h2>Mark Munoz vs. Chris Weidman</h2>
Munoz has been on a middleweight tear and by all common logic he should be able to either knock Weidman silly or take him down and pound the hell outta him. I just think Weidman is gonna be ready for ALL of it. Call me crazy, but I think Weidman's background in wrestling, and Serra jits should pose a problem should it hit the mat, and his fundamental boxing with Ray Longo helped him overcome Alessio Sakara. Munoz lands in the plus corner for power and experience, but Weidman has very little pressure to beat the Phillipino Wrecking Machine and I think that calmness is gonna persevere as the fight goes on. Call me crazy here, but...        WEIDMAN by DECISION
