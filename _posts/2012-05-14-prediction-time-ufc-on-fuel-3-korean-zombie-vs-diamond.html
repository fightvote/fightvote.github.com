Let's have Will Smith flash that light thingie from Men In Black into my eyes annnnnnd........ here we go with some fight picks!

PRELIMINARY CARD (Facebook)
<h2>Francisco Rivera vs. Alex Soto</h2>
Think Soto got completely outmatched by the cruise missile that is Michael McDonald. I think he gives the new comer something to think about.   SOTO by TKO
<h2>Jeff Curran vs. Johnny Eduardo</h2>
Curran's got the jits skills to stay clear of the game of Eduardo.  Just has to play smart.   CURRAN by DECISION
<h2>Rafael Dos Anjos vs. Kamal Shalorus</h2>
Tough fight. Shalorus certainly has the power to KO or de-jaw Dos Anjos, but I just think the Brazilian is gonna come out and expose the age of Shalorus (whatever the hell that is).  DOS ANJOS by DECISION
<h2>T.J. Grant vs. Carlo Prater</h2>
Grant is  a big lightweight. Too big for Prater and he throws just too darn hard.   GRANT by TKO
<h2>Marcus LeVesseur vs. Cody McKenzie</h2>
McKenzie is fighting for his UFC job. AND he shaved, so you KNOW he's serious.  LeVesseur is gonna do take down after take down. Sooner or later, he's gonna get caught in a choke.  MCKENZIE by ALASKAN GRIZZLY CHOKE
<h2>Brad Tavares vs. Dongi Yang</h2>
Both guys coming off losses. I think the Ox goes to work and gets some useful tips in the locker room from Chan Sung.  YANG by SEOUL CRUSHER

&nbsp;

MAIN CARD (FUEL TV)
<h2>Tom Lawlor vs. Jason MacDonald</h2>
Love Filthy Lawlor, but MacDonald worked the Canadian Penal Circuit long enough to know you gotta just win baby in the UFC. It won't be pretty or crowd pleasing, but ... MACDONALD by MOUNTIE HOLD
<h2>Fabio Maldonado vs. Igor Pokrajac</h2>
Serious leather being chucked in this one. I think either man has the capabilities to end this early and it might just be a matter of who lands first. Pokrajac has more momentum than the Brazilian, but the granite in Maldonado's chin just seems a little denser.  MALDONADO by KO
<h2>Jeff Hougland vs. Yves Jabouin</h2>
Jabouin is coming off two split decisions here. I don't think there's a third.   HOUGHLAND by DECISION
<h2>Donald Cerrone vs. Jeremy Stephens</h2>
Cerrone gets his head straight here and guess what, doesn't stand in front of his opponent and get teed off on. Stephens has serious power and will come out aggressive, even has the chance to overwhelm Cerrone in the early going.   That said, Cerrone has never lost two in a row. Doesn't start now. Not with Lil Heathen.     CERRONE by DECISION
<h2>Jorge Lopez vs. Amir Sadollah</h2>
Kinda crazy how Sadollah is only 5-3. All those in the UFC to boot.  I like Lopez and his future bu think Sadollah's here to impress all his old high school buddies.   SADOLLAH by HOME CROWD  INFUSED FRENZY
<h2>Dustin Poirier vs. Chan Sung Jung</h2>
It'll be interesting if the Zombie can come up with another magic trick as impressive as a twister or 7 second KO. If he can, he can stop Poirier. If he can't, it's gonna be a tough road getting past the Diamond.  Because this is being touted as a title-contender bout, I expect it to be a split decision or a weak unanimous decision.   POIRIER by MEH DECISION

<h2>LAST CARD RESULTS</h2>
6 -6                My worst forecasting thus far, thought Jim Miller was gonna be more of a problem for Nate Diaz. I was very, very wrong.
<h2>ON THE YEAR</h2>
60 - 34
