Alexander Gustafsson, heir to the throne of Sweden (or so I assume), continued his nice hot streak decision-ing Thiago Silva and for the first time in his career, he saw the end of the third round. Go figure, but this was the first time we had to hear the judges' scorecards for a Gustafsson fight. Silva is a tough customer and took quite a multitude of Swedish Strikes, but as I figured, he looked a little lackadaisical most likely a result of the 15 month layoff. We did not get a chance to see Gustafsson's ground game which was disappointing. No matter how studly he looks against the Thiago Silvas of the world, we need to see him against a strong explosive wrestler before his name should even come up in the Jon Jones opponent conversation. And no, Matt Hamill can not be considered "explosive".

Little Nog/Bader/winner of Forest and Tito. That's the kind of guy I'm assuming he'll get. Provided he passes that test, Machida or Shogun's name will probably come up. Aside from the striking prowess, the Swede's footwork looking stellar. The guy danced like Ali for most of the fight, something you don't see often for a guy who's 6' 5".

Props also to Thiago for coming in and taking a beating and keeping in the fight. I like Thiago and hope his health maintains so we can see him more often. He tagged Alex a couple times right in the chomper, and I think that's more a testimony to Alexander's chin, than a dip in Thiago's power.
