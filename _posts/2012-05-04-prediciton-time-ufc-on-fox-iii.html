<p>Yay, back on Fox. That means that NFL trumpet fanfare and the Real Steel robots, but hey, it's free, so... yeah. Maybe Hugh Jacksman will corner one of them. The robots that is. Not the fighters.</p>
<p>PRELIMINARY CARD (FUEL TV)</p>
<h2>Mike Massenzio vs. Karlos Vemola</h2>
<p>That's a lot of man meat trying to make the cut to middleweight in Vemola, and although I do like his power, I think Messenzio's conditioning and textbook wrestling are gonna pull Vemola into deeper water. MASSENZIO by DECISION</p>
<h2>Roland Delorme vs. Nick Denis</h2>
<p>Nick Denis looked great in his last bout, let's blow on the dice and keep it rolling.  DENIS by TKO</p>
<h2>Dennis Bermudez vs. Pablo Garza</h2>
<p>Garza is tall for a featherweight and I can't stand the way he hangs his chin out there with a little bow wrapped around it, but he does have experience and some nifty jits. Bermudez got a little out of his game in his TUF battle with Diego Brandao and I hope he settles in a little bit more to this prelim bout now that there's less spotlight. Wouldn't be surprised to see Bermudez land the big punch but Garza should be able to sneak out a win.   GARZA by SUBMISSION</p>
<h2>Danny Castillo vs. John Cholish</h2>
<p>Castillo is no joke having wrested a decision from Nkojuani recently, whom I like quite a bit.  Cholish has some potential and he'll learn from this one, but Castillo gets the big check tonight.   CASTILLO by DECISION</p>
<h2>Louis Gaudinot vs. John Lineker</h2>
<p>Little guys who could kick my ass going head to head here. Lineker's on a nice little non-UFC win streak and I don't think Gaudinot has the tools or treachery to derail it.  LINEKAR by DECISION</p>
<h2>John Hathaway vs. Pascal Krauss</h2>
<p>Hathaway's a beast. Krauss won't debeastify him.  HATHWAY by TKO</p>
<h2>John Dodson vs. Tim Elliott</h2>
<p>Welcome to the UFC, Tim Elliott. While ranked exceedingly high in the flyweight division, little is known about Tim Elliott.  What IS known has probably been assessed and cracked by Greg Jackson. DODSON by annoying laughter.</p>
<h2>Tony Ferguson vs. Michael Johnson</h2>
<p>Hmm, Michael Johnson surprised me in his bout with Shane Roller but I don't think he does it again. FERGUSON by TKO</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MAIN CARD (FOX)</p>
<h2>Pat Barry vs. Lavar Johnson</h2>
<p>Damn. Heavy, heavy leather coming down in this one. I think Barry plays it smart and leg kicks the ever loving hell outta Johnson. As long as he can move in and out, Barry should be able to earn the W with a mixed game plan, but good lord, does Lavar have some hurting bombs..and as we saw with the Kongo fight, Barry is susceptible to a well placed chin knock.  But what heavyweight isn't? After waffling like a politician, I'm just gonna go with the man who's hard to kill.   JOHNSON by KO</p>
<h2>Alan Belcher vs. Rousimar Palhares</h2>
<p>All of the fights on the main card could go either way.. hats off to Joe Silva for making this a tough one. We all know that Palhares has a Buffalo Bill dungeon where he keeps arms, legs, heels, and and knees from his opponents and I'm not sure Alan Belcher is Clarice Starling. I really like Belcher and rode his jock even after inexplicable losses to guys like Jason Day (yeah, him!) and Kendall "Can't spell Spider correctly" Grove.  The asterisk in this fight is that Alan Belcher has a black belt in BJJ. Palhares is a jedi, but Belcher is no Padawan (happy Star Wars - May the 4th be with you day).  Cal me crazy, but ...  BELCHER by DECISION</p>
<h2>Johny Hendricks vs. Josh Koscheck</h2>
<p>Josh Koshcheck looked VERY so-so in his last scrap with Mike Pierce, and Johny Hendricks is NO Mike Pierce. Hell, Johny gets done with one N what most other Johnny's do with two. That makes him special, and even though Koscheck has over 873 fights in the UFC (or something).. I think the experience factor gets a rude awakening.  BIG RIG by KO</p>
<h2>Nate Diaz vs. Jim Miller</h2>
<p>Diaz and his go-go gadget arms are a match for anyone looking to engage in a kickboxing match. Good thing Miller has zero intention of doing that. Look for the home-cage advantage to come in handy and although he's gonna be a bloody mess unrecognizable to his own mother, I expect Miller to wrest away the decision and maybe get flicked off by the Diaz brothers.   MILLER by DECISION</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Last card results:   7 -4</h2>
<p>Hats off to Ben Rothwell and Eddie Yagin for pulling out big wins. Damn you Brendan Schaub,.. damn you.</p>
<p>On the year: 54 - 28</p>
