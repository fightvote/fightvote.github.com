THE DIALOGUE:

Pressman: "The celebration at the Kamayurá's Tribe is for receive a warrior. Anderson Silva got out of the Octagon and went to the north of the Xingu River, at (Brazilian State) Mato Grosso, to exchange experience with Indian. Experts in Uka-Uka, a kind of wrestling, practiced by the tribes of the region."

Spider: "The mind is like a parachute, always open."

Pressman: "With an open mind, the philosopher Anderson Silva heard the stories of Indians. The tradition of the indigenous fight is millennial and was adapting over time. All very different from the glamor of the UFC. In the UFC, Anderson Silva has been making history. At the Kamayurá's Tribe, simplicity and dedication, which begins at the 13 years old."

Indian: "We spent two and a half years in commitment, preparing to be a fighter, scraping the skin and passing roots."

Pressman: "Anderson didn't have to do this, but here is a tradition that no Uka-Uka warrior can escape, have to turn a beast."

Indian: "We're painting him as one ounce."

Pressman: "He didn't convince like a ounce. He will try to convince us fighting. Take the kids out of the room and register that historical moment. What was seen is unbelievable. Anderson Silva was neutralized, was knocked out. And only after being "beaten", he began to learn the technique. So, Anderson Silva has returned to be Anderson Silva."

Spider: "It's different the way they fight. The techniques used are very strong. As my current coach says, the mind is like a parachute, always open."

Pressman: "Was late for the philosopher to speak again. And there are more "open minds" in the Tribe. And Anderson became a coach."

Indian: "I liked that stroke."

Spider: "What stroke? I'll teach you." (Anderson teaches some moves to the Indian)

Pressman: "In the end, a great celebration to thank the visit of a great idol of the world, and the union of MMA with Uka-Uka. Everyone won. And, of course, was a lesson, the mind always open!"
