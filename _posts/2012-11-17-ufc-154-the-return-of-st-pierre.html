He was, like, a big deal a year ago.  Well if you don't recall, don't worry.  Let's get to some predictions!

&nbsp;

PRELIMINARY CARD (FX, 8 p.m. ET)
<ul>
	<li><strong>Azamat Gashimov vs. Ivan Menjivar</strong>I'd be surprised if Gashimov can surprise the veteran with anything he hasn't seen before. Menjivar should drive the ten minutes from where he trains, do what he does in training, collect his check and sleep in his own bed that night.    MENJIVAR by SUBMISSION</li>
	<li><strong>Darren Elkins vs. Steven Siler</strong>A good battle and Elkins always seems to wrestle his way into winning. Siler's striking has looked good but until Elkins deviates from his battle plan, the same thing will probably keep working.  ELKINS by DECISION</li>
	<li><strong>John Maguire vs. Matt Riddle</strong>Tough battle here, and I like Maguire's grit and submission skills. But Riddle is a massive welterweight and I think he'll use that to negate Maguire's game.   RIDDLE by DECISION</li>
	<li><strong>Antonio Carvalho vs. Rodrigo Damm</strong>I'm not sold on either of these guys quite yet, but I'm REALLY unsold on Damm who doesn't even have the benefit of fighting in Brazil or against a guy who shouldn't be in there (Gazparszhino... Gazpacho?).  Carvalho by TKO</li>
	<li><strong>John Makdessi vs. Sam Stout</strong>This is Stout's fight all day long. I'd be shocked if Makdessi could find a way here to outstrike Stout (he can't). And Stout's pretty good at staying off the ground.   STOUT by TKO</li>
	<li><strong>Cyrille Diabate vs. Chad Griggs</strong>Diabante should be able to pick apart Griggs with some sharp, precise striking. The only problem is that I don't think Griggs will care. Griggs should walk through most of that and get his grave-digging mitts on the snake and pound it up.   GRIGGS by TKO</li>
	<li><strong>Patrick Cote vs. Alessio Sakara</strong>Cote's fight to lose. His chin is great, which is where Sakara could win, but Cote has a lot riding on this, it's on home turf, and he's just better at the all around game.    COTE by DECISION
MAIN CARD</li>
	<li><strong>Mark Hominick vs. Pablo Garza</strong>Uh boy, tough tough tough tough tough.  Both of these guys are probably fighting for their jobs. Hominick however can probably out point Garza over three rounds.  HOMINICK by cautious DECISION</li>
	<li><strong>Mark Bocek vs. Rafael dos Anjos
</strong>
Bocek's wrestling vs. dos Anjos's everything else.  Sorry for the broken record, but the wrestling game of Bocek is only negated by the likes of Jim Miller and Benson Henderson.     BOCEK by ZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  <strong>
</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Tom Lawlor vs. Francis Carmont
</strong>
Joe Silva's killing me here with these matchups. Outside of Quebec, I'd go Lawlor. However... Carmont will have thousands in his corner and I don't think he'll succumb to Filthy.  CARMONT by SUBMISSION</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Johny Hendricks vs. Martin Kampmann</strong></p>
I don't know why or how or when, but Kampmann will find a way to win this fight and take the wheels off the Big Rig. I could be dead wrong and I'll curse under my breath if Hendricks' hands find that chin but the Dutchman has been through sooooooo much to get here. I don't think he lets it slip away.   KAMPMANN by ???????</li>
</ul>
<strong>Champ Georges St-Pierre vs. interim champ Carlos Condit (welterweight-title unification)</strong>

This is gonna be a helluva fight (copyright Joe Rogan) and it could be any man's night. I think it's a razor close fight and GSP will have to do everything he can to win 3 outta 5 rounds. Be he does it.   GSP by SPLIT DECISION
