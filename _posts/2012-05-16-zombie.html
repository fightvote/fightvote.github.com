Generally speaking, I think we got our money's worth. Or lack of money's worth (if you have Fuel).        HOW CAN ANYBODY NOT LIKE THE KOREAN ZOMBIE?!   Like a few of you, I still had that lingering image of George Roop throwing that leg kick that represented his last loss. Wrongly, I believed Dustin Poirier's striking was going to be as, or even more successful.  Chang Sung Jung actually made the hard core fans salivate a bit at the thought of him and Aldo mixing it up down the road. Thanks to a post-fight comment by Dana White it looks like that's the case. Could be a bit of a wait if there's collateral damage from the scheduled Erik Koch scrap in July. Would Aldo get an immediate title shot if he loses? Would they try to put the Zombie vs. Champ fight on in South Korea?  Who knows. Probably no on 1, yes on 2.

I had an off night with fight predictions, actually I was worse than a coin flip. I think I need to get back to basics: Having two turtles with the names of fighters scrawled in chalk on their backs, race across my kitchen floor.
