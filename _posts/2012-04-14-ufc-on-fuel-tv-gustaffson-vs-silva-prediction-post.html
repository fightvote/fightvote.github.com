Hey we're back!  Quite the long UFC layoff there, hopefully you were keeping sated on Bellator or the Ultimate Fighter tv show, but now we're back to basics and the UFC looks like it's gonna have a busy, busy summer. So let's get right back into it with the first ever Swedish UFC visit.  For the record, I'll probably be favoring blondes when making the predictions!

&nbsp;

PRELIMS:
<h2>Jason Young vs. Eric Wisely</h2>
Sure he's not very blonde, but I think Jason Young should be able to handle business here without too many problems.  YOUNG by DECISON.
<h2>Simeon Thoresen vs. Besam Yousef</h2>
Norway vs Sweden. I think Thoresen is the better fighter and despite the home court advantage, he should spoil the spirits of the Swedish faithful.  THORESEN by DECISION.
<h2>Yoislandy Izquierdo vs. Reza Madadi</h2>
Madadi looked pumped at the weigh-ins and I think he'll bring it into the cage.  MADADI by TKO.

&nbsp;
<h2>Francis Carmont vs. Magnus Cedenblad</h2>
Hard fight to pick. Magnus sure looked to have the size advantage and I think he'll use it well. CEDENBLAD by DECISION

&nbsp;
<h2>Tom DeBlass vs. Cyrille Diabate</h2>
The Snake bites again.   DIABATE by TKO.
<h2>Papy Abedi vs. James Head</h2>
A tough fight for Papy but I think he gets his first win in the Octagon. ABEDI by KO.

&nbsp;

MAIN CARD
<h2>Damacio Page vs. Brad Pickett</h2>
Pickett's energy level should be the difference maker here.  PICKETT by DECISION.

&nbsp;
<h2>DaMarques Johnson vs. John Maguire</h2>
Close fight, but DaMarques and his experience level are gonna be the difference maker. JOHNSON by DECISION.

&nbsp;
<h2>Diego Nunes vs. Dennis Siver</h2>
Two exciting strikers here and it should be quite the battle. I'm not excited about this being Siver's first fight at 145.  Nunes should pull away late. NUNES by DECISION.

&nbsp;
<h2>Siyar Bahadurzada vs. Paulo Thiago</h2>
Can Thiago pull off a submission? He's gonna be his only hope. I don't think he can handle the blitzkrieg power of Siyar.  BAHADURZADA by TKO.

&nbsp;
<h2>Alessio Sakara vs. Brian Stann</h2>
This should be a tailor made fight for Stann as Sakara has neither the capability nor the inclination to take down the Marine.  STANN BY KO.

Alexander Gustafsson vs. Thiago Silva

The layoff for Silva is weighing in my decision here a bit, and the big Swede just has too much momentum for a guy who's been out over a year to take it from him. This should be a bloody affair, but I see a late home-pleasing knockout.  GUSTAFFSON by TKO.

&nbsp;
<h2>LAST CARD RESULTS</h2>
<h2>5 - 7.</h2>
Not a good night for me in Japan. Boetsch coming back from the dead, Mark Hunt defying.. well, everything, and Rampage checking out really hurt me here.

<strong>39-20 on the year.</strong>
