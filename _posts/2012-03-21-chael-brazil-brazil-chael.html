MMAjunkie reporting that Chael will face his old buddy Anderson Silva for the middleweight strap June 16 or 23rd in Rio.

Dana White referenced a soccer stadium that could accommodate 80,000 people. And no, that's not a typo.  80,000.... whoa.

Anyway, I just emailed Chael <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKiPPo2z5Kghttp://">this little ditty</a>. I hope he gives it a few listens while he trains.  Trains triangle defense, that is.
