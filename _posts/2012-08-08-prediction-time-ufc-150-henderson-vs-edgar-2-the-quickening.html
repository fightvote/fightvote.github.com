Hey, we're back on Pay Per View (yay?), and unfortunately the Olympics are STILL going on and thus will be siphoning some viewers away from this card. UFC 150 has a lot to live up to after an amazing Fox card last week. Ok, enough foreplay. Here we go.

PRELIMINARY CARD
<h2>Nik Lentz vs. Eiji Mitsuoka</h2>
Both these guys are probably fighting for their jobs. Lentz has shown us that yes, he looks like the stunt double for Nick Stahl, but yes, he also isn't very exciting to watch. Maybe training with American Top Team has added some dynamism to his game (probably not), but it's a good camp and Mitsuoka IS coming over from Japan. As much as I want Mistuoka to capture the fire of his glory days and unleash some crazy submission, the travel and altitude are probably gonna take their toll.  LENTZ by DECIZZZZZZZZZZION
<h2>Dustin Pague vs. Chico Camus</h2>
Pague, who fights with Jesus in his corner, should be able to use the height and reach to keep this fight where he wants it. Camus is getting his first UFC check after fighting local circuits like the Madtown Throwdown and Racine Fight Night, I'm not kidding about those. Even though he's training with Duke Roufus who trains Anthony Pettis, among others, I have apprehension backing "the new guy."   PAGUE by DECISION
<h2>Ken Stone vs. Erik Perez</h2>
Erik Perez fights outta Jackson's in the ABQ, and Ken Stone, despite his last name, isn't threatening enough to disrupt Jackson's Jedi-Like counseling when it comes to winning game plans. PEREZ by SUBMISSION
<h2>Jared Hamman vs. Michael Kuiper</h2>
Hamman has fought the better competition than Kuiper but damn if he doesn't put his chin on a silver platter when he fights. Kuiper got out-Gracie'd in his last fight with Rafael Sapo Natal and I think he'll make some adjustments and come in looking for that chin. KUIPER by TKO
<h2>Dennis Bermudez vs. Tom Hayden</h2>
Tom Hayden likes to submit folks, and damn, Bermudez has gotten submitted in three of his last four fights. Can he buck the trend? Sure he can. Will he though? Hmmm... Yeah.   BERMUDEZ by DECISION

MAIN CARD
<h2>Justin Lawrence vs. Max Holloway</h2>
Justin Lawrence could not have looked better in his UFC debut, winning the TUF crown and delivering a head kick knockout that seemed straight out of a movie. Holloway is tall for a featherweight (5' 11") but I don't think the length will be a problem for Lawrence. Provided he didn't exhaust himself with the weight cut, Lawrence should take this. TUF winners have, for the most part, proved themselves worthy and Holloway is not dangerous enough to derail the journey. LAWRENCE by TKO
<h2>Yushin Okami vs. Buddy Roberts</h2>
I'd be shocked if Okami hasn't learned from his two straight losses to not get this one here. Roberts is only making his second UFC fight and Thunder is no joke, despite getting Boetsch'd outta nowhere last time around. Using smothering wrestling and constant pressure, I like Okami to get back to his winning ways here.  OKAMI by DECISION
<h2>Jake Shields vs. Ed Herman</h2>
An extremely tough fight to call. Herman's been a different fighter since his return from injury, finishing his last three opponents. Shields however is returning to middleweight (a weight class where he defeated Dan Henderson) after a 1-2 stint at welterweight in the UFC. Shields should be able to impose his jiu jitsu game here, something that befell Herman in the majority of his losses. I'm not sure if his sub defense has advanced to levels that can fend off Jake Shields. While I'm leaning toward the slight upset here and picking Herman, the smart money would have to be on Shields.  Then again, they're fighting in Denver, a hop skip and jump away from Ed Herman and I tend to think home court does have an advantage.  F- it,   HERMAN by TKO
<h2>Donald Cerrone vs. Melvin Guillard</h2>
Guns will be blazing, at least in the first round, and while Guillard has as much or more power than anyone else in the lightweight division, I think this is somewhat of a tailor made victory for Cerrone. Guillard's best chance is to overwhelm him early and often and hope against hope he can fluster the Cowboy. I just think Cerrone is too smart for that and too quick to stay immobile. CERRONE by SUBMISSION
<h2>Champ Benson Henderson vs. Frankie Edgar (for lightweight title)</h2>
Oh boy. Here we go. Edgar has made his career from being counted out, either before a fight (v. BJ Penn) or during a fight (v. Maynard), and coming back to win. He's Rocky Balboa jammed inside a 5'6" New Jersey guy. And yes, I think he WAS winning their last fight until that upkick split his face open and changed the momentum. But Smooth is big. And Edgar is not. The checks that Edgar's body has been writing at some point need to be cashed and I see a very similar go around to the last fight. Henderson's freakish flexibility should eliminate worries on the ground should Edgar go for subs and Henderson is able to stay away from big bombs by closing distance quickly and muscling his opponents.  HENDERSON retains title via DECISION
