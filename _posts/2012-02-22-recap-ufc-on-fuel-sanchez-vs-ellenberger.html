The evidence keeps piling up on how tough Diego Sanchez is, unfortunately it wasn't enough to take a W back to New Mexico with him. Jake Ellenberger didn't exactly lay an inarguable claim on the No. 1 contender spot, but he didn't exactly blow it either.Â  Ellenberger and his knees did enough damage to Sanchez so even when he was coasting in the 3rd and ran into the reinvigorated "Dream", he had the points to take the decision.

Thankfully, this will be the last time we get a 3 round Main Event and it's a shame we couldn't see Round 4 and 5 between these two. Sanchez has got a gas tank fit for a jetliner and his last round flurry was impressive, considering he might have suffered a broken nose in Round 1. Sanchez gets clipped a lot as he comes in though, and Ellenberger seemed to study enough tape to see these openings.

Both of these guys really slugged it out with bad intentions, especially Ellenberger. Looking over the right, his right and left hooks were thrown with gritted teeth like he was in a movie. While not as impressive over his win over Jake Shields, he should pose a worthy test for Condit, should they go ahead and book that rematch.

This is the right weight class for Sanchez. I think he needs to employ more knees and kicks to set up his wrestling, and I wouldn't mind him being more offensive with his submission game. His heart alone makes any opponent at 170 a winnable fight.
