MAIN CARD (Pay-per-view)
<h2>Rich Frankin vs. Wanderlei Silva</h2>
As much as I'd like to think Silva can pull this one off, Franklin is too crafty to play into Silva's game. He's also the bigger guy and might could negate Silva's Muay Thai by wearing him down against the cage, or the ground should he get a takedown. It's not the storybook ending, but Franklin wins one in Brazil.  FRANKLIN by TKO
<h2>Cezar "Mutante" Ferreira vs. Sergio "Serginho" Moraes</h2>
Mutante is a complete fighter and looks massive in there against other middleweights. Unless Serginho whips out some crazy Ryo Chonan shit, this should be Mutante all day.   FERREIRA by TKO
<h2>Rony "Jason" Mariano Bezerra vs. Godofredo "Pepey" de Oliveira</h2>
Extremely tough fight here. Wouldn't be surprised at any outcome. I think Bezerra's heart will earn him a contract one way or another, but I think Pepey is the safe play here.   de OLIVEIRA by DECISION
<h2>Mike Russow vs. Fabricio Werdum</h2>
I think Werdum is gonna have to kill Russow before Russow quits. That said, Werdum has him beat almost everywhere but chin.  WERDUM by DECISION
<h2>Yuri Alcantara vs. Hacran Dias</h2>
Alcantara by OVERDOSE of A's. Or Decision, whichever comes first.

PRELIMINARY CARD
<h2>Rodrigo Damm vs. Anistavio "Gasparzinho" Medeiros</h2>
Damm all day. Despite the pro-Gazpacho crowd.  Damm hates Gazpacho soup.  DAMM by SUBMISSION
<h2>Francisco "Massaranduba" Drinaldo vs. Delson "Pe de Chumbo" Heleno</h2>
This is a fight I was hoping would happen in the finals. Both of these guys have replaced their fists with anvils.  HELENO by TKO
<h2>John "Macapa" Teixeira vs. Hugo "Wolverine" Viana</h2>
Macapa vs. Wolverine should be a good scrap. I think Teixeira has the skills to put out the (slight) upset but 5 pounds over weight is unacceptable. WOLVERINE by DECISION
<h2>Leonardo "Macarrao" Mafra Teixeira vs. Thiago de Oliveira Perpetuo</h2>
Perpetuo?  Perpetuo!   PERPETUO by DECISION
<h2>Marcos Vinicius "Vina" Borges Pancini vs. Wagner "Galeto" Campos</h2>
Campos? Yeah, Campos..Sure, why not.  CAMPOS by DECISION
<h2>Felipe Arantes vs. Milton Vieira</h2>
I can't believe these two studs are FINALLY gonna fight.  ARANTES by DECISION

<h2>Last card:</h2>
8-4   (missed by chance at 9 when the doctors stopped the Catone-Camozzi fight due to cuts)
<h2>On the year:</h2>
92-60
