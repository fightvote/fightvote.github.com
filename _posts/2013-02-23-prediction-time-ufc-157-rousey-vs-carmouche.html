HISTORY in the making people.  So glad to be entering a nice stretch of big cards.
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Main Bouts (on Pay-Per-View):</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>
</strong>Ronda Rousey (6-0) vs. Liz Carmouche (7-2)</h2>
Why mess with a good thing? I think Ronda's got enough jits to stay outta Liz's mount. Plus, she'll make it interesting every time it goes there.  ROUSEY by DECISION
<h2>
Lyoto Machida (18-3) vs. Dan Henderson (29-8)</h2>
Hard fight to pick. After going back and forth, I wonder if Henderson is dynamic enough to find the target. I really hate the ring rust coming off Henderson and that and only that makes me lean the Dragon's way.   MACHIDA by SUBMISSION
<h2>
Urijah Faber (26-6) vs. Ivan Menjivar (25-9)</h2>
Faber hasn't looked great lately, but I think he has enough fundamentals to wrest this one from the veteran.  Menjivar has looked pretty good recently, but not good enough for somebody at Faber's level. FABER by DECISION
<h2>
Court McGee (13-3) vs. Josh Neer (33-12-1)</h2>
Another great fight (Good Work Joe Silva). Both of these guys are probably fighting for their jobs.I think McGee's size and durability will probably be the difference. MCGEE by TKO.
<h2>
Josh Koscheck (17-6) vs. Robbie Lawler (19-9)</h2>
Holy shit, this fight is actually gonna happen? Both of these guys have been a lay off of sorts, and I think Koscheck has the wrestling edge which is where it's gonna be determined. As much as I love the sound of a stand up war, Koscheck knows how to win (usually).   KOSCHECK by DECISISON
<h2><strong>Preliminary Bouts:</strong></h2>
<h2>
Bredan Schaub (9-3) vs. Lavar Johnson (17-6)</h2>
Lavar Johnson hits hard. Schaub doesn't react too well to that. If he can't get Johnson down, bwa-oh!   As much as people say Schaub is the next thing at heavyweight, I haven't yet seen it.  JOHNSON by KO.
<h2>Michael Chiesa (8-0) vs. Anton Kuivanen (17-5)</h2>
Chiesa likes to wrestle and is very good at it. Not sure if Kuivanen can keep up.  CHIESA by DECISION
<h2>Dennis Bermudez (9-3) vs. Matt Grice (15-4)</h2>
Not sure if Grice has the jits game to catch Bermudez but these guys look noticeably different size wise.  GRICE by DECISION
<h2>Sam Stout (19-8-1) vs. Caros Fodor (7-2<strong>)</strong></h2>
Stout could really use some consistency. Not sure if Fodor is a foil or a phenom, but Stout'll find out for us.   Let's play it safe.   STOUT by DECISION
<h2>Kenn<strong>y </strong>Robertson (11-2) vs. Brock Jardine (9-2)</h2>
I think both of these guys have been prone to tough matchups in their losses. Let's go Jardine because I like his uncle Keith.  JARDINE by DECISION
<h2>Jon Manley (7-2) vs. Neil Magny (7-2)</h2>
Manley by manly wrestling.  MANLEY by DECISION
<h2>Nah-Shon Burrell (8-2) vs. Yuri Villefort (6-1)</h2>
Huh? Who? What?    I dunno, but I tend to err on the side of the guy who came into a welterweight fight as a middleweight.  Burrell (MAKE WEIGHT NEXT TIME) by TKO

LAST CARD RESULTS:    5 - 6  (Don't you %$&amp;#ing LOOK AT MEEEEEEE!)

On the Year:   18 - 15
