Well, Ian McCall came in with momentum in a way after throttling Demetrious Johnson in Round 3 of their first fight. Hell, if even stopped beating up on Johnson to scream at the crowd. Now, he's back to the end of the line after looking like an also-ran. Not sure if it was an off night for Uncle Creepy, or Demetrious Johnson just improved exponentially, but it really wasn't close.  Now Johnson goes under the knife and subsequently heals up for his title fight against Joseph Benavidez at some point probably in the end of 2012.  It's gonna be a hard fight to sell...
