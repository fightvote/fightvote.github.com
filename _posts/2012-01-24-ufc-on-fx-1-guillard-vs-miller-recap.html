The Pride of Whippany, NJ sure flew home with something to be proud of, as Jim Miller kinda-sorta-pretty much did what I thought he was gonna do and beat Melvin Guillard in front of a Nashville crowd.

Coming into the cage to "Bad Moon Risin" Miller weathered the powerful punches and knees, sticking to Guillard like white on rice. In fact the first minute was ALLLL Guillard, as the yellow haired "Blackzillian" dropped Miller, bloodying his opponent and keeping composed during the exchanges.

Miller kept pressing the action though, and after a Jose Aldo flying knee that he ate like a champ, the fight went to the ground and you basically could count the seconds til the fight was over with Miller RNC'ing Guillard to force the tap.

Jim Miller is a special fighter and is extremely efficient when he's not being out wrestled by the likes of Benson Henderson, Frankie Edgar or Gray Maynard.

As far as Melvin goes, I really don't know where he goes from here. No one questions his talent, at least I don't, but he makes silly mistakes that, at this level, will always be capitalized on by top tier fighters. Switching training camps to the Blackzillians in Florida didn't do much to dispel the stigma that Melvin just can't put the puzzle pieces together for big fights.

All it took was that one mistake (the flying knee where they ended up on the ground) and Melvin was in over his head. Maybe he spends a year working JUST the ground game and comes back a more complete fighter. Or maybe like Eddie Murphy, Melvin peaked in his early 20's..
