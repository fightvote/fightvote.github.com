Annnnnnnnnd we're back!   Because I'm sure nothing interesting happened between now and UFC 150, I'm just gonna drop right into the prediction part of the post.
CHARLIE BRENNEMAN VS. KYLE NOKE

I think Brenneman should hold off Noke, despite the size advantage. Brenneman by DECISION
MITCH GAGNON VS. WALEL WATSON

I like Watson's explosiveness and I'm apt to pick him here, but I like Gagnon's wrestling and punching power more. Gagnon by TKO.

SETH BACZYNSKI VS. SIMEON THORESEN

Baczynski by SUBMISSION

MARCUS BRIMAGE VS. JIM HETTES

Hettes all day by SUBMISSION

LANCE BENOIST VS. SEAN PIERSON

Benoist on a hunch.

EVAN DUNHAM VS. T.J. GRANT

Grant's too big, too strong.  Grant by DECISION

VINNY MAGALHAES VS. IGOR POKRAJAC

Pokracjac by face punching to the max. TKO

CHARLES OLIVEIRA VS. CUB SWANSON

Swanson's on a roll. I'd be impressed with Oliveira if he can catch Cub sleeping. Swanson by TKO.

MATT HAMILL VS. ROGER HOLLETT

The Hammer's back. At least for one more. Hamill by TKO.

MICHAEL BISPING VS. BRIAN STANN

Bisping. Because he knows how to win against a guy like Stann.  BISPING by TKO, or a Submission that Stann gives him.

JOSEPH BENAVIDEZ VS. DEMETRIOUS JOHNSON

Gonna have to watch this in slo-mo later to see what the hell is happening, but when the dust settles, Joe will have it. Benavidez by DECISION

CHAMP JON JONES VS. VITOR BELFORT

Too easy.  Jones by KO.
