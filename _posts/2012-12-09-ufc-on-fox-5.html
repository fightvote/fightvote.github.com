Holy stacked card!

&nbsp;

Ok, let's get right to the nasty because I ran outta time this week.

&nbsp;

MIKE SWICK vs. MATT BROWN

Swick's ground game with get him through this scrap, but it won't be unscathed. SWICK by late SUBMISSION

&nbsp;

MAURICIO SHOGUN RUA vs. ALEX GUSTAFFSON

Alex I think is ready for this.   GUSTAFFSON by TKO

&nbsp;

BJ PENN vs. RORY MCDONALD

Rory's too big. Too strong. I'd love BJ to prove me wrong.   MCDONALD by DECISION

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

CHAMPION BEN HENDERSON vs. NATE DIAZ

Henderson's athleticism and wrestling coupled with his unsubmissable limbs will be the difference.   HENDERSON by DECISION
