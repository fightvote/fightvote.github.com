Fast and furious today, ladies and gents. "I want my belt back!"

&nbsp;

MAIN CARD (FX)
<h2>Clay Guida vs. Gray Maynard</h2>
Maynard has problems with guys named Frankie Edgar. Clay Guida is not named Frankie Edgar.  MAYNARD by Decision.
<h2>Spencer Fisher vs. Sam Stout</h2>
Stout by being just a step quicker in every area. STOUT by DECISION
<h2>Brian Ebersole vs. T.J. Waldburger</h2>
Ebesole has to show me something before I pick against him. EBERSOLE by TKO
<h2>Ross Pearson vs. Cub Swanson</h2>
DUI aside, I think Ross is gonna be the stronger fighter.  PEARSON by TKO

Preliminary Card
<h2>Hatsu Hioki vs. Ricardo Lamas</h2>
Hioki is on a roll. It won't stop with Lamas, despite the good wrestling.  HIOKI by SUBMISSION
<h2>C.J. Keith vs. Ramsey Nijem</h2>
Here's where I get railroaded by some UFC debutante. I really want to pick Keith here, but I'm playing the safe card after I took a dive last card.  NIJEM by DECISION
<h2>Brock Jardine vs. Rick Story</h2>
Story all day long.  STORY by KO
<h2>Joey Gambino vs. Steven Siler</h2>
Siler looked great in his last fight. I imagine he'll keep the train running. SILER BY TKO
<h2>Matt Brown vs. Luis Ramos</h2>
Ramos can't kill an immortal. At least I don't think he can. BROWN by TKO
<h2>Chis Camozzi vs. Nick Catone</h2>
Tough tough tough fight to call.  Let's go with Catone. CATONE by DECISION
<h2>Ricardo Funch vs. Dan Miller</h2>
C'mon Miller, let's see if you can get a finish for once.  MILLER by SUBMISSION
<h2>Dustin Pague vs. Ken Stone</h2>
Let's give Pague another shot, despite the shaky chin suspicion.   PAGUE by DECISION
