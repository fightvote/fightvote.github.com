Lyoto Machida fought like an End Boss and snatched a title shot opportunity down the road (late 2012?) away from his rival Shogun Rua. While I agree he was more "impressive" I'm still pretty lukewarm on Dana White's decision making process. While both of these guys won, they didn't BOTH fight Ryan Bader. Who's to say that Machida would have been able to finish Brandon Vera?  Or that Shogun would have knocked out Bader within two rounds. If I want to find out which one of my grandparents is more impressive at Tetris, I have them both play, well, TETRIS!  Just so you know, they're both terrible.  It's a flawed approach to finding contenders for the belt and I'd rather Number 1 Eliminator Bouts are done away with in general.  Let Dana and Joe Silva sit around and look at the guys who could challenge for the belt, give each of them a call, and then decide.  Historically, when Dana announces a fight where the winner gets a title shot, you typically have unexciting fights or lame split decisions. Remind me to give you examples* on this later.

Some other thoughts from the night.
<ul>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Damarques Johnson got knocked out when Swick caught his kick, took him down, and dropped a hurting bomb(s). Unfortunately for Johnson, he braced his fall with his left arm, preventing him from defending Swick's punch. Not to all future fighters, don't brace your fall, instead protect your head.</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Varner's broken hand robbed us from seeing an even better fight. I think he had Lauzon on the scorecards before that happened. Anytime you see a guy mess with his gloves during a fight, it's a pretty good sign something's wrong.</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Nam Phan's combos are amazing to watch. Did this guy play Killer Instinct as a kid?</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Omigawa needs to cut to 135 or never fight again in the UFC. He's just not the same guy when he leaves Japan.</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Can we get doctors who speak the same language as the patients they speak with? It seemed that Wagner Prado had no idea what he was saying when the doctor was talking to him after the eye poke. And Wagner, buddy, you can't tell a doctor you can't see if you want the fight to continue. You gotta stall, or blink a lot, or something. ANYTHING, but "I CAN'T SEE!"        Luckily these two will lock horns in Minneapolis at UFC ON FX 5 in October.</li>
</ul>
