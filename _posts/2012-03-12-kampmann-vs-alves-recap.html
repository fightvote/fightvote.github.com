I would have gotten them all right...  I promise. 100 %.  Not one miss...  Believe me?  Ok, because I don't either. Well Christmas came early for the "Hitman" as Thiago Alves felt generous and GAVE away the fight in the third round. You'd have to be living in a sensory-deprivation chamber if you had that one scored for Kampmann prior to the silver plated offering Alves did of his own neck. Reminded me of the fight between Nate Diaz and Melvin Guillard back in 2009 when Melvin mistakenly thought:

Sloppy Takedown Attempt
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">+ Exposed Neck Against Jiu Jitsu Black Belt </span>

= Guaranteed Win!

I really have no idea where Alves' head was at that moment. Maybe he was trying to show off his well rounded game in a fight he was winning, just so that his next opponent would be aware he could wrestle?  Maybe he thought if I can't KO Kampmann than maybe I could submit him in the last couple minutes of Round 3?  Or maybe he didn't think and it was instinctual to go for the takedown when he saw Kampmann planted and moving slowly?  I'm just not sure. Good to see the kid make weight though.  At least that's something.
Kampmann and his lucky win (I like Kampmann and think he has skills, but c'mon, that was lucky) probably move to a top 8 guy.  Maybe winner of Macdonald - Mills? Seems like he's fought almost everybody else in the division.  I doubt he gets the winner of Koscheck - Hendricks. Charlie Brenneman needs an opponent.. I dunno. Could be worse. Who'd you like to see the Hitman take on?
