PRELIMINARY CARD
<h2>Mike Brown vs. Daniel Pineda</h2>
I'm not sold on Brown at 36 years young, and I like Pindea to play a smart game, avoid the power bombs and get a nice notch on his belt.  PINEDA by DECISION
<h2>Kyle Kingsbury vs. Glover Teixeira</h2>
Kingsbury spent a lot of time and energy coordinating his weigh in outfit, and I think Teixeira trained to fight.  TEIXEIRA by DECISION
<h2>Paul Sass vs. Jacob Volkmann</h2>
I think Christmas should be able to get Sass to the mat, because, well Sass is British. What happens after that is anyone's guess, but hey!, here's one:   SASS by SUBMISSION
<h2>Dan Hardy vs. Duane "Bang" Ludwig</h2>
Hardy has to win SOMETIME, doesn't he?  I mean, c'mon, doesn't he?  Or does he?   LUDWIG by SHEER IMPROBABILITY
<h2>C.B. Dollaway vs. Jason "Mayhem" Miller</h2>
If Mayhem can't submit Dollaway, I think he's done. If YOU reading this can't submit Dollaway, then you need to practice more. Mayhem looked ripped at the weigh-in so here's hoping a better version than the one that faced Bisping came to fight.  MILLER by SUBMISSION
<h2>Edson Barboza vs. Jamie Varner</h2>
OUCH! My legs and head and face and things already hurts. This fight is gonna be closer than it looks on paper, but Barboza is just doing everything right and I don't think Varner can stifle him long enough to find a W.   BARBOZA by DECISION
<h2>Diego Brandao vs. Darren Elkins</h2>
I'll go the slight upset pick here and take Elkins to outwrestle Brandao. Brandao channels the other Diego from time to time, so there's a chance he gets caught in one of those Tasmanian Devil flurries. Sometimes you just have to go against the grain.   ELKINS by DECISION

MAIN CARD
<h2>Lavar Johnson vs. Stefan Struve</h2>
Lavar throws bombs and tires quickly. Struve has a PHD in surviving and winning.  This should be case work, but Struve has a nasty history of avoiding my picks. I think he reads 'em and psyches himself out.  STRUVE by SUBMISSION
<h2>Shane Del Rosario vs. Stipe Miocic</h2>
Ugh, I really wanna back Del Rosario here but I hate the long layoff. Miocic has done nothing but prove he belongs in the UFC, so let's let the Croatian walk his walk.   MIOCIC by DECISION
<h2>Dave Herman vs. Roy Nelson</h2>
Roy Nelson does everything better than Dave Herman except maybe sit-ups and shave. I think Roy will have plenty of options to finish this one.  NELSON by SUBMISSION via STOMACH SUFFOCATION
<h2>Antonio Silva vs. Cain Velasquez</h2>
Antonio Silva does not go away easily, but Velasquez is just too fast for a heavyweight. I think he redeems himself a bit after the KO to Dos Santos.    CAIN by late TKO
<h2>Champ Junior Dos Santos vs. Frank Mir (for heavyweight title)</h2>
I'm not believing the hype train about Mir and the kimura heard round the world. He was in trouble after sustaining strikes from Big Nog. Dos Santos is a faster, stronger, younger version who is PISSED.  This won't be pretty.  DOS SANTOS by KO

<h2>LAST CARD RESULTS:</h2>
5 - 7        Remind me not to buy LSD from the assistant manager at Chuck E. Cheese. I was out of my frigging mind when I made those last picks.

<h2>ON THE YEAR:</h2>
65 – 41
