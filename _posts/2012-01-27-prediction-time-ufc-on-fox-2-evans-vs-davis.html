<strong>MAIN CARD (FOX)</strong>

<strong>RASHAD EVANS vs. PHIL DAVIS</strong>

<strong> </strong>Ok, tough call time. If you have a shiny silver dollar, now would be the opportunity to flip it. And because I stopped calling coin flips since my run in with Anton Chigurh, I’ll elaborate a bit on this fight. Rashad wants that fight with Jon Jones. He wants it real bad. Since losing the belt to the Dragon, Rashad has defeated an impaired (bad back) Thiago Silva, a rusty Rampage Jackson, and a fraudulently “resurrected” Tito Ortiz. In fact, I think he wants it so bad he may be able to stop the runaway hype train that is Phil Davis. Davis has shown nothing but good things since he popped on the scene, adding in the last few fights a creative submission game to his smothersome wrestling. I don’t like the fact that Davis has been away from the sport since TCOB in a March, 2011 scuffle with Little Nog. And if he had fought within the last four or five months, I’d almost bank on Davis w/o hesitation. But dammit, ring rust is a real thing and I have to give it its proper weight. As much as I’d love to say Davis will pull out the upset, I think Rashad has too many weapons.   <strong>EVANS by CLOSE DECISION.</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Chael Sonnen vs. Michael Bisping</strong></li>
</ul>
When Mark Munoz hurt his elbow and pulled out of his fight with Sonnen, fans were rewarded with one of the year’s most salivating matchups. Had this fight happened two or three years ago you could reduce it to a simple “wrestler vs. striker”. But thankfully, both fighters have evolved from being pigeonholed like that. Michael Bisping is a master game-planner. Together with his coaches, he tends to execute low-risk, high yield strategies to come out on top. He’s also very good at pressuring hurt, exhausted, or dazed fighters. He does not however possess the submission game needed to take out Chael Sonnen. As we’ve seen in the past few years, Chael cannot be outstruck on his feet, nor can he be outwrestled. He can, however, fall victim to any number of submissions, most notably and frequently, the arm triangle. I expect Chael to stalk Bisping down, showing that his time with boxing coach Clayton Hires is proving fruitful. Bisping has good takedown defense and superb footwork, but it will not be good enough to stave off the single or double leg of a determined Sonnen. Bisping hasn’t submitted anyone in years and I doubt he suddenly lucks into one here.    <strong>SONNEN by UD, or late TKO.</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Demian Maia vs. Chris Weidman</strong></li>
</ul>
This fight is a lot closer than it looks on paper and as it stands now, is the toughest fight for me to predict. Maia has shown in his recent fights, that under the tutelage of Wanderlei Silva, his stand-up game has shown drastic improvement. And despite being outmuscled by Mark Munoz and flummoxed by Anderson Silva, his recent fights paint a picture of a jiu jitsu ace who is now blending into a more balanced fighter. Weidman is no stranger to taking fights on short notice, and so far, it’s worked out extremely well for him. Training with the Serra/Longo team should mean two things: on point boxing, and a crafty ground game. Toss into that mix the kid’s natural wrestling pedigree and we’re looking at a real dangerous prospect, knocking at the door of the middleweight top tier. And although Maia has tapped out his share of wrestlers, I think Weidman can escape the niftiness of Maia and ride out an upset.   <strong>WEIDMAN by UD.</strong>

<strong>PRELIMINARY CARD (FUEL TV)</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Evan Dunham vs. Nik Lentz</strong></li>
</ul>
Lentz has made it this far with a stifling wrestling game, despite losing a C in his first name somewhere. Grinding out opponents and threatening with submissions when he’s on his back can make people forget his abject striking, which let’s face it, ain’t pretty. Dunham ran into the buzzsaw that was Melvin Guillard but bounced back from a long layoff with a clear cut victory over Shamar Bailey. I think the Oregon Duck will make it two in a row by varying the offense on Nik to pull off a 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> round submission. <strong>DUNHAM by SUBMISSION.</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Michael Johnson vs. Shane Roller</strong></li>
</ul>
Roller’s on another level here, and although Michael Johnson has shown some nice explosiveness and athleticism, Roller’s experience and better ground game should tip the scales in his favor. This is probably a “loser leaves town” scenario and I imagine MJ will be submitting <em>résumés. </em> <strong>ROLLER by SUBMISSION.</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Jon Olav Einemo vs. Mike Russow</strong></li>
</ul>
Initially hesitant to back a fighter like Russow who doesn’t devote his full day to training, and instead has to literally police the streets of Chicago. Despite looking like he just walked off the set of Troy, Einemo will want to get Russow down and not exchange too much with the granite-chinned cop. If that happens, Einemo should be able to find a choke or an arm. However, I like Russow’s grit, and backed by the Chicago crowd, should be able to muster the determination to work his way back up to the feet.  <strong>RUSSOW by TKO.</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>George Roop vs. Cub Swanson </strong></li>
</ul>
Vice President Joe Silva really did a helluva job with this card as I’m having an aneurysm trying to pick most of these match-ups. Both Swanson and Roop have had a series of ups and downs over the last couple years, failing to put together a noticeable string of wins. Swanson did have a nice run in the WEC before meeting up with Jens Pulver. I like the KO opportunities here for both fighters, as Roop has proven he can destroy even zombies. He does however have a problem tucking his chin, a chink I’m pretty sure Swanson will be trying to exploit. Roop’s length, and fury over getting the round end of a split decision last time around, will be the difference.  <strong>ROOP by TKO. </strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Charles Oliveira vs. Eric Wisely</strong></li>
</ul>
This will be Oliveira’s overdue featherweight debut and even though Wisely has amassed some victories over lightweight notables Hermes Franca and Matt Veach, Oliveira is a special fighter who, at 22, has showed a skillset of someone five to ten years older. I like Oliveira to work those long limbs to his advantage.  <strong>OLIVEIRA by SUBMISSION.</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Joey Beltran vs. Lavar Johnson </strong></li>
</ul>
This should be a good old fashioned knock-down, drag-out slug fest but just as nobody puts baby in the corner, nobody knocks out these two bastards. Beltran has shown weakness when it comes to cardio, and Johnson has fallen victim to the gentle art of jiu jitsu. The short and sweet of it, I don’t think Beltran has the ground game to finish Johnson and thus I see a somewhat sloppy, but cheer-frenzy back and forth. Wouldn’t be surprised if Beltran found Johnson’s button and put him out, but my money’s on Big Lavar.    <strong>JOHNSON by SPLIT DECISION.</strong>

<strong>PRELIMINARY CARD (Facebook) </strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Chris Camozzi vs. Dustin Jacoby</strong>
Despite the home-cage advantage for Jacoby, the more experienced Camozzi should come out on top here without much trouble. <strong>CAMOZZI by SUBMISSION.</strong></li>
</ul>

<strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PREVIOUS CARD PREDICTION RESULTS</span></em></strong>

<strong>7- 3.</strong>    I was right on the money with my Jim Miller over Melvin Guillard prediction but Josh Neer surprised me with his choke-out of Bang Ludwig. Also, I was happy to be proved wrong by Jorge Rivera. Happy Trails, Conquistador! Way to go out with a win.
