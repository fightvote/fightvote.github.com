NBK FTW.

This fight had a world of pressure upon it - because it was for the Interim Championship but also because the Fabricio Werdum and Roy "looking like an extra from the 1987 film Over the Top" Nelson fight was so amazing - and in the end it was a bit underwhelming, but only because of the anticipation. That said, I think this fight was a lot better than most people give it credit for. Condit and Diaz were so evenly matched, it almost became a "mirror match" where similar height, reach, and skill sets negate one another.

Scoring the fight was quite the arduous task.  The first two rounds I gave to Diaz, despite the bevy of leg kicks Condit was able to land. The third and fourth I gave to Condit. Seemingly the game plan for Diaz went off track between Rounds 3 and 4. It was as if he abandoned the pressure-striking attitude that had been more or less working. The change allowed Condit to start throwing every kick he had in the book, including that sick left hook, left leg kick, right head kick combination that looked straight outta Tekken.

Round five was the decisive one. Diaz started well with the kicks to Condit's body, something he needed to do a lot more of the whole fight.  Condit never found purchase for that spinning back elbow/fist but damn, it sure looked pretty.  The kicks stopped for Diaz and he resumed stalking Condit down, but the man with a thousand mile cardio looked tired and tentative when he should have been the one to turn it on. He got hit a lot more in Round 5 and couldn't muscle the energy to get the fight down to the ground when he had the body lock. Diaz did get the take down and executed some submission attempts but just didn't have enough time to sink it in. Maybe with another minute or two, it would have been enough to secure the round.

I would have been happy with a win for either, or a draw, but hats off to Condit for digging deep here  to pull it out.  Sometimes it really motivates a guy when he has the opportunity to play spoiler.  Diaz vs. GSP is gonna have to wait.. but hey, crazy stuff happens and athletes get hurt, Diaz still may be one phone call away from filling in for Condit down the road. Buuuuuuuut, then he had to go test positive for marijuana. ...  Damn.
