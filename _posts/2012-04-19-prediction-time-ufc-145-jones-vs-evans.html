<div>PRELIMINARY CARD</div>
<div></div>
<h2>Marcus Brimage  vs. Maximo Blanco</h2>
Haven't seen much of Blanco except for his Strikeforce loss to Pat Healy. Brimage hasn't impressed me, but he's fighting close to home and may have extra fuel in the tank because of it. I'm not loving this pick, but let's go with the Bama Beast.   BRIMAGE by DECISION
<h2>Keith Wisniewski vs. Chris Clements</h2>
Wisniewski has got the huge experience advantage and was stopped by cuts when he faced Josh Neer last October. Clements is gracing the Octagon for the first time and even though he took care o' bidness against Rich Clementi the smart money here is probably on the Polish dude. But not much money, Clements has some KO power.  WISNIEWSKI by SUBMISSION
<h2>Mac Danzig vs. Efrain Escudero</h2>
Yuck. Barf. Meh. Glarg. Wish I could abstain on this one. DANZIG by SUBMISSION
<h2>Anthony Njokuani vs. John Makdessi</h2>
Should be a good fight. I think Njokuani's reach proves too much. NJOKUANI by DECISION
<h2>Stephen Thompson vs. Matt Brown</h2>
Careful what you wish for, Matt Brown...   WONDERBOY by TKO, (or late submission set up by strikes.)
<h2><strong>Travis Browne vs. Chad Griggs</strong></h2>
Should be a bloody affair. Although I hate to doubt Griggs, I think Browne's gonna come away with it.  BROWNE by DECISION
<h2>Miguel Tores vs. Michael McDonald</h2>
As long as the kid doesn't get caught sleeping and wind up in a desperate last ditch submission, I think McDonald is gonna prove he's ready for the big(ger) guns at 135. Taking it to the Streets with MCDONALD by DECISION

MAIN CARD
<h2>John Alessio vs. Mark Bocek</h2>
Love Alessio. Don't love the two weeks notice. BOCEK by SUBMISSION
<h2>Mark Hominick vs. Eddie Yagin</h2>
No way Hominick drops three in a row. Speaking of dropping, I'd wager Yagin tries the 135 circuit after this fight.  HOMINICK by TKO
<h2>Brendan Schaub vs. Ben Rothwell</h2>
Schaub's a tough fighter to predict. He SHOULD be able to mix it up on the feet against Rothwell. He SHOULD be able to take Rothwell down and keep him there. I just hope this isn't one of those fights where he underestimates the guy and ends up getting his bell rung by some Rothwell high kick. Ugh. Ok, pal. Giving you a chance here.  SCHAUB by DECISION
<h2>Rory MacDonald vs. Che Mills</h2>
Fight of the night candidate and one of those fights where you really gotta tip your hat to Joe Silva. Real difficult fight to call. Canada vs Britain. I think the kid takes it.   MACDONALD by SUBMISSION
<h2>Jon Jones (champ) vs. Rashad Evans</h2>
I've seen nothing in Jon Jones' fights that deter me from backing him here. Seriously, are you going to say that part in Round 1 against Machida we saw Jones at his most vulnerable and THAT'S the reason you're picking against him? Or that Evans trained with him and "knows his weakness"?  Please.     While Evans has talked a good (somewhat convincing) game that he's gonna be the one that "exposes" Jones and can a) take him down or b) land the big right hand, I just don't see him getting inside to do it. Jones is a special fighter, someone we haven't seen in this sport EVER and yes, I'm including Anderson Silva in that statement. I think Evans' work with the Blackzillians should have his submission defense on point and he'll squirm out of a couple close calls but in the end though, I think Jones can and will dictate how this fight goes.  JONES by TKO

<h2>Last Card Results</h2>
8-4.  Officially off the Papi Abedi hype train by the way. Any of you guys still hanging on? Also, didn't expect Siver to hang tough at 145, go figure.   Even though he lost, be sure to remember the name <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Yoislandy Izquierdo. </strong>Kid looked sharp in defeat.</span><a title="Yoislandy Izquierdo" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoislandy_Izquierdo"><span style="color: #000000;">

47 - 24 on the year.
