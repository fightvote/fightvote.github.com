Sorry no recap on last card, but I was still sleeping after watching Ebersole-Head, Kongo-Jordan, and Lombard-Boetsch....

Ok, let's see what we got here:

PRELIMINARY CARD
<h2>Ulysses Gomez vs. John Moraga</h2>
Starting things off with some UFC rookies here. Moraga's outta Arizona Combat Labs, while Gomez claims Marc Laimon's Cobra Kai.  Let's go Ulysses Gomez here based purely on first name coolness.   GOMEZ via DECISION
<h2>Manny Gamburyan vs. Michihiro Omigawa</h2>
Yikes. Both guys presumably fighting for their job with the company, Gamburyan and his funky shoulder should be able to handle Omigawa whose last win in the US came in 2006 (some guys hate to travel I guess).  MANVIL by TKO.
<h2>Josh Grispi vs. Rani Yahya</h2>
I remember when Grispi was 14-1 and knocking at the door for a title shot. My how things have changed after an injury lay off and losses to George Roop and Diamond Poirier.  Yahya hasn't fared much better but at least he's got his first UFC victory outta the way.  Let's give Grispi one more chance but either way, both these guys are snake-bit and there's a chance one or both are coming into this thing pretty banged up before the bell even sounds.   GRISPI by DECISION
<h2>Phil De Fries vs. Oli Thompson</h2>
You got me why this British Brodown is being staged in California and not Manchester or Sussex or somewhere Limey. I think De Fries pulls it out, but Oli is the world's strongest man (T.V. says so) and could exert some of that truck pulling strength here early should the hands land.  But I'm not ready to put money on that.   DE FRIES by SUBMISSION
<h2>Phil Davis vs. Wagner Prado</h2>
Lose to Rashad, wind up on the undercard I guess.  Davis attempts to bounce back from his first career defeat to Suga, by taking on heavy handed Prado, who's the UFC debutante this weekend. Even though Prado is a vicious KO artist, Phil Davis is,.. well, Phil Davis.   DAVIS by SUBMISSION
<h2>Cole Miller vs. Nam Phan</h2>
A very weird pairing when they pose for their weigh in staredown, Miller should be able to work his jab and kicks and keep the shorter Phan at a distance here. The jits edge is also Miller's, and while it's hard to ever count Phan outta a fight, I think he's gonna have his hands full with Miller.  MILLER by DECISION

MAIN CARD
<h2>Mike Swick vs. DaMarques Johnson</h2>
"Where have you gone,<del> Joe Dimaggio</del> Mike Swick?"     Poor Swick. His body hates him. After 98 years away from the Octagon, Swick returns to face the hit and miss Johnson. Normally, anybody with that much ring rust would scare me away, but Swick has fought much better competition and been victorious. Plus, he fought guys at 185, including the massive Okami. Then there's the bright lights of a FOX Main Card to consider and Swick certainly has had the bigger fights on the bigger stages. Swick, provided an alien doesn't burst through his chest when the bell rings, should take this.    SWICK by SUBMISSION
<h2>Joe Lauzon vs. Jamie Varner</h2>
Tough fight on paper and probably a tough fight in the ring. Varner blew everyone's mind when he KO'd the previously unKO'd Edson Barboza. I don't want to drink the kool-aid and think one KO can resurrect a career (Tito vs Bader anyone?) I do think Varner is crafty and seasoned enough to stay in this fight. Lauzon hasn't looked tremendous against the top tier dudes, and while Varner is far from a top ten dude, I think he can win here, just not sure how.  VARNER by SPLIT DECISION
<h2>Lyoto Machida vs. Ryan Bader</h2>
Machida's a puzzle as they say, and Bader doesn't strike me as someone who spent a lot of time playing Tetris. Yes, Bader is bigger, stronger, younger, and fist-pumpier than Machida, but the dragon really only was susceptible to the cunning striking and unnatural submission game of Jon Jones and an ill-fortuned punch from Shogun. Bader does not possess this type of artistry.  MACHIDA by DECISION
<h2>Mauricio "Shogun" Rua vs. Brandon Vera</h2>
Uh, boy. Here we go. Do I believe Shogun is still Shogun? Do I believe that the Henderson fight "broke" him as it would any other man? Do I believe Vera has regained focus and blah blah blah blah blah?  Until he shows me otherwise, Vera will be a lot of untapped potential or derailed promise or whatever bullshit thing I'm supposed to think about when they start pimping a Vera fight.  As much as I'd like to see Vera come out with reckless abandon and reclaim the glory that was once kinda-maybe-possibly supposed to be his, I just think you gotta walk the walk, and frankly, he hasn't in a very long time.  And true, Shogun might be a well-animated corpse that has been kept alive with nutrients and electro-shock and Voodoo witchcraft since Dan Henderson killed him last November, but I'll have to allow the man to prove his shortcomings in the Octagon. Until then however...          SHOGUN by TKO
