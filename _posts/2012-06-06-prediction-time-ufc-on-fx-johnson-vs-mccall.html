PRELIMINARY CARD
<h2>Jake Hecht vs. Sean Pierson</h2>
Just a hunch.                       HECHT by DECISION
<h2>Bernardo Magalhaes vs. Henry Martinez</h2>
Martinez is undersized and managed let slip a split decision to Matt Riddle his first UFC fight. Now with a full training camp, I think he comes in ready.   MARTINEZ by TKO
<h2>Caio Magalhaes vs. Buddy Roberts</h2>
Black belts usually prevail in guys named Buddy.   Plus, I have to pick at least ONE guy named "Magalhes."             MAGALHAES by SUBMISSION
<h2>Tim Means vs. Justin Salas</h2>
Battle of the stupid nicknames, "The Dirty Bird" vs. "J Bomb".  Let's go with Means, because he's tall and well.. I have a trip to Atlanta coming up.    MEANS by DECISION
<h2>Dustin Pague vs. Jared Papazian</h2>
Papazian made it a fight with Easton in his last fight, and Pague is years away from that level. PAPAZIAN by TKO
<h2>Leonard Garcia vs. Matt Grice</h2>
Garcia has to get a win sooner or later. It's sooner.   GARCIA by TKO
<h2>Seth Baczynski vs. Lance Benoist</h2>
Benoist is a young gun with a fair bit of steam . Baczynski finds ways to win. BENOIST by DECISION
<h2>Mike Pierce vs. Carlos Eduardo Rocha</h2>
Pierce beats everybody but collegiate wrestlers. Rocha looked great in defeat to Ellenberger, and passed every other opponent in his way. Rocha has Brazil in his corner after Pierce's insults, and he's going to be hard to put away. While I think Rocha winning makes for a good story, Pierce plays spoiler.  PIERCE by close DECISION

MAIN CARD (FX)
<h2>Scott Jorgensen vs. Eddie Wineland</h2>
I can't believe these guys haven't faced each other before.  Jorgensen went a full 3 with Barao (who nobody wants a piece of) and usually going 3 with a really tough opponent makes you better.  Wineland went the full time with both Benavidez and Faber so I guess that maxim is out. I wouldn't put 1 red cent on this one, but I think Jorgensen finally gets around to showing what his purple belt in BJJ is all about.                     JORGENSEN by SUBMISSION
<h2>Josh Neer vs. Mike Pyle</h2>
Good scrap in the making here.  These guys are basically the same person, with a rift in the space-time continuum allowing the 29 year old Neer to face his 36 year old self (Pyle). Let's go with the youth vote.  NEER by SUBMISSION
<h2>Charlie Brenneman vs. Erick Silva</h2>
Brenneman is a real meat and potatoes kinda fighter and has power-negating wrestling that has served him well in his wins. Erick Silva is a flashy Brazilian wunderkind who got DQ'd in his last fight for strikes to the back of the head. Referee Mario Yamasaki really got roasted for that call and you can argue most of the shots missed, but most is not all, and a few DID sneak through. Silva's got a big chip on his shoulder to dazzle and regain his winning ways.  Tough call. Let's bank on the shiny toy and go with Silva, but I wouldn't be surprised to see old fashioned suppressive Greco-Roman Brenneman get it done and if that happens I'm gonna kick myself.   SILVA by SUBMISSION
<h2>Demetrious Johnson vs. Ian McCall</h2>
McCall has more weapons and a bigger bone to pick since the last fight down in Australia was bungled by the judges. He has a vendetta you might say. And because he looks like guy Fawkes, II think he comes in and takes away the W.    MCCALL by hard-fought DECISION

&nbsp;
<h2>LAST CARD RESULTS</h2>
John Albert never tapped, so my score should be better. Kim Winslow = terrible ref.  Aside from that, I'm ok with my picks.   I NAILED the Kampmann- Ellenberger pick.
I'm not messing around here guys, you should listen to me.

7 - 3
<h2>ON THE YEAR</h2>
80 – 48

63% correct. Put that up against the main pundits and see how it looks.
