He toyed with Frank Mir on Saturday, seeming in no distress or hurry to take out the former champ. While the Cain rematch could be interesting I just can't see things going much differently at this point.  Alistair Overeem, Daniel Cormier, or M. Bison (ongoing visa issues a problem) are all on the top of my list as candidates for a JDS title fight, but as of now, this guy looks unbeatable.    Jon Jones, you listening?
