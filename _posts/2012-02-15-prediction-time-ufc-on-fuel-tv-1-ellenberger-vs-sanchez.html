MAIN CARD (FUEL TV)
<h2>JAKE ELLENBERGER vs. DIEGO SANCHEZ</h2>
"Yes"! Diego returns in his first fight in almost a year and ("Yes!") I think he may be a bit rusty/unequipped when meeting the recent Ellenberger buzzsaw. ("Yes!") Expect Ellenberger to employ a similar game plan that John Hathaway used in his win over Sanchez and outwrestle and outpower the Dream ("Yes!"). Diego might be able to luck out with some kamikaze flurry early in the first or second round, but I just think Ellenberger is too tough to let it affect him. Both of these guys will probably visit the hospital tonight, but only Ellenberger will have another W to take with him. ELLENBERGER by DECISION.
<h2>Dave Herman vs. Stefan Struve</h2>
I'm almost always wrong when it comes to picking Struve fights.  I'll probably keep that streak alive, and I almost think he'll be able to apply something sneaky on Herman in the guard. I'm not super confident of Herman's mind right now coming off the drug suspension. But Herman doesn't lose against too many guys and I don't think Struve has the skills to be one of them.  I know you are.... but what am I?  PEE WEE by TKO.
<h2>Ronny Markes vs. Aaron Simpson</h2>
Good match-up here, and I think both guys are looking to establish themselves in that "door-knocking" position of the top 10-15 middleweights. This is Markes first fight at middleweight and he should have a strength advantage, but I'm a little hesitant to back him without seeing what the cut did. Simpson should try taking this into round 3 and hit the after burners to eek out a win. SIMPSON by DECISION.
<h2>Philip De Fries vs. Stipe Miocic</h2>
Battle of the Undefeateds, and one of the harder fights to call. I think Miocic has the wrestling credentials to keep De Fries from applying the jits game, but it wouldn't surprise me to see an early tap from the Brit.  Tough call, but I think Miocic will keep his "0" a little longer. MIOCIC by TKO.
<h2>T.J. Dillashaw vs. Walel Watson</h2>
The Gazelle here has just too many weapons, and with the height I'd wager can keep Dillashaw and his wrestling at bay.  WATSON by TKO.
<h2>John Albert vs. Ivan Menjivar</h2>
Menjivar should be a tougher test than Albert had in his first UFC fight against Dustin Pague. With over 30 fights, Menjivar should be able to avoid the big punch from Albert and ride out a win.  MENJIVAR by DECISION.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Really apprehensive about predicting the prelims, as most of these guys are as new to me as they are to you. The only one I'm going to forecast is the Brookins - Rocha fight.
<h2>Jonathon Brookins vs. Vagner Rocha</h2>
Brookins is just gonna outwork the Brazilian. He just better keep that chin tucked.  BROOKINS by DECISION.

&nbsp;
<h2>LAST CARD RESULTS</h2>
<h2>9-2<strong>     (30-10 on the year)</strong></h2>
I was a double-point deduction from being 10-1 on the last card. Thanks Herb Dean! But honestly, those shots to the nuts Bruce Leeroy threw made me cringe for a good couple minutes.  I was right on the money with Werdum, Koshcheck, Barao, and Ed Herman - even down to the method of finish. Hope you won some money.
