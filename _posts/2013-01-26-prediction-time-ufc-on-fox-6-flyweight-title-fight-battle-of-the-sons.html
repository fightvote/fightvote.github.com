Lot of free UFC going around. Let's hope it stays.  So we're back from Brazil. I made it through customs! Alright let's do this.

<strong>FX Prelims:</strong>
<h2>Simeon Thoresen and David Mitchell</h2>
Thoresen has put together a nice little resume fighting in every MMA promotion known to man. Should be able to take out a guy with a year and a half of ring rust making his UFC debut. Should being the optimal word.    THORESEN BY SUBMISSION
<h2>Rafael Natal vs. Sean Spencer</h2>
Don't know much about this Spencer kid. Natal is probably sore after losing to the lucky Andrew Craig. I think he rights the ship and shows off that fancy black belt.  NATAL by SUBMISSION
<h2>
Mike Russow vs. Shawn Jordan</h2>
Both dudes are coming off a loss. Jordan lost boringly to Kongo, while Russow got KTFO'd by Werdum. Perhaps Russow has ran out of gas in his UFC run (he IS 36) and perhaps Jordan isn't the mega prospect some were thinking.  Russow's got one more in him.   RUSSOW by DECISION
<h2>
Ryan Bader vs. Vladimir Matyushenko</h2>
Bader is the bigger and younger Matyushenko.  Maybe not "stronger" as you can never count out Russians, and Bader has been susectible to old fighters (i.e. TIto). But I'd say that was a fluke and Bader really only comes up short on the magicians of MMA (Jones/Machida).   The Russian could find Bader's chin with some Soviet might and end this thing and I wouldn't be surprised if it happened but I gotta go with Bader here.     BADER by TKO
<h2>
Mike Strumpf vs. Pascal Krauss</h2>
Being conservative here and going Krauss. He was perfect until running into John Hathaway.  Stumpf makes it a fight.  KRAUSS by DECISION
<h2>
Clay Guida vs. Hatsu Hioki</h2>
Clay Guida's not losing this fight. Not in Chicago.   GUIDA by DECISION
<h2>
TJ Grant vs. Matt Wiman</h2>
Wiman is one of the toughest fighters to predict in the UFC. He's certainly won fights he shouldn't have and lost fights he shoulda won. Grant has looked damned unbeatable since joining the lightweight ranks. Everything says Grant so that's why it has to be Wiman.  It's damn metaphysical.  But I just can't see HOW.  I've flip-flopped way too many times on this.  Damn me.   GRANT by DECISION

<strong>Fox Main Card:</strong>
<h2>Erik Koch vs. Ricardo Lamas</h2>
The rust on Koch is over a year old and Lamas has been on a roll. I love Koch but  he has to start again after all the injuries.   LAMAS by DECISION
<h2>
Anthony Pettis vs. Donald Cerrone</h2>
Should be a killer fight. Everything says FOTN.  Cerrone wants it bad and their skills are comparable and sometimes you gotta go with the guy who wants it more.  CERRONE by DECISION
<h2>
Quinton Jackson vs. Glover Teixeira</h2>
Oh boy oh boy. Smart money is on Teixeira right? After all, he's looked great. He's got everything going for him. Sometimes though it's Fate that you can't beat.  Call me ubersentimental but Quinton goes out with a KO.   JACKSON by KNOCKOUT
<h2>
Demetrious Johnson vs. John Dodson</h2>
So far Demetrious looks the part of the champion and I don't think Dodson's ready.  I would love a finish, but we know how that goes in the flyweight division.   JOHNSON by DECISION

&nbsp;

Last card results  6-5

On the year:    6 -5
