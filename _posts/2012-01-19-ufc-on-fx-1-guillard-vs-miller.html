So FX jumps into the MMA mix hosting their first UFC event in Nashville, Tennessee.
Let's get to it!

<strong>MAIN CARD</strong>

<strong>MAIN EVENT:  GUILLARD  vs. MILLER</strong>

Both of these fighters recently had their parties spoiled by other lightweights (Lauzon and Henderson respectively), and hope to right the ship with a win over another tough lightweight. Guillard's power is probably his best weapon here against Miller (or most any other lightweight) but Miller has proven to be good in all fields, and gritty as they come. I think Miller's going to be savvy enough to avoid the stand-up of Guillard and take this fight to the ground where I think he'll move from one submission to the next. Eventually he'll find it.             MILLER via Submission.

<strong>Duane "Bang" Ludwig vs. Josh Neer</strong>

This has FOTN written all over it, but as we saw in his last fight against Amir Sadollah,  Bang Ludwig's stand-up is crisp as an autumn apple. Josh has some good striking albeit without k.o. power.  This is going to be a Carrie-esque bloodbath and I'm REALLY hoping we can make it through 15 minutes without a doctor stoppage, and there's a likelihood of that happening pretty early, but if the Gods of Good Fights is looking down I see this thing going the full 15 in a terrific back and forth.      LUDWIG by Decision.

<strong>Mike Easton  vs. Jared Papazian</strong>

A very strange match-up to put on the main card, but I reckon the UFC has high hopes in promoting Easton, who's a monster in the bantamweight class. Papazian is making his shiny debut in the UFC and I am ALWAYS reluctant to bank on a guy who's going in with those first time jitters.  Despite not having seen a lot of fights from Easton, my gut says he's the pick.                EASTON by TKO, ROUND 2

<strong>Pat Barry vs. Christian Morecraft</strong>

Pat Barry hasn't been the luckiest fighter the past year, but I see the hard work put in with Brock at Team Death Clutch paying off as we see a well rounded game employed to keep Morecraft off balance.  And even though Barry is dealing with a height and reach disparity I expect him to Tyson himself to the inside and work Morecraft with some vicious strikes. Morecraft has bounced back from getting hurt before to come up with the victory but it doesn't happen here.           BARRY by TKO, ROUND 3 or a RNC set up by knocking Morecraft down.

PRELIMINARY CARD (FUEL TV)
<ul>
	<li><strong>Jorge Rivera  vs. Eric Schafer</strong>
Tough call. I think Rivera's done though. Prove me wrong Jorge, prove me wrong. Schafer by Submission.</li>
	<li><strong>Khabib Nurmagomedov  vs. Kamal Shalorus</strong>
Nurmagomendov has youth, experience, and an undefeated record going for him and I expect his Sambo background to stifle Shalorus's wresting. Even though this is his first UFC fight, I like the Russian.   Nurmagomedov via lopsided UD or Round 2 Stoppage.</li>
	<li><strong>Charlie Brenneman  vs. Daniel Roberts</strong>
Brenneman gets back on track.  Brenneman by Decision.</li>
	<li><strong>Fabricio Camoes  vs. Tommy Hayden</strong>
Camoes should be able to put away the newcomer.  Camoes by Submission.</li>
	<li><strong>Daniel Pineda vs. Pat Schilling</strong>
Just a gut instinct here. Schilling by Submission.</li>
	<li><strong>Nick Denis vs. Joseph Sandoval
</strong>Lack of experience for both guys, but I wouldn't be surprised with some nice striking by Denis.  Denis by KO.LAST CARD RESULTS  6 -3  (not counting the Silva - Prater fight b/c it could be overturned).  Upset with myself for not giving the weigh-in debacle more credence in the Belfort - Johnson fight.</li>
</ul>
