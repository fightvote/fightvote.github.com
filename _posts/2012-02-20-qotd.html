Quote of the day from Chael Sonnen's manager.  Apparently there's a lot of internal discussion WHERE exactly this Rematch of the Century is taking place.  I'm sure Anderson and his camp want it in Brazil. Dana White has made mention to a soccer stadium that could seat upwards of 40,000 (or more).

However, MMA Manager ("MManager?")  Mike Roberts who reps Sonnen is hesitant about that arrangement.
<p style="color: #000000;">“Of course. I had a legitimate concern for Chad Mendes'safety,” Roberts stated when alluding to one of his other clients who fought in Brazil recently.</p>
Overall however, despite facing a home country favorite in Jose Aldo, Roberts says that Mendes was received well in Brazil. Now Chael Sonnen, that’s a different story entirely.

“Chad Mendes had a great time; Brazil treated him phenomenally. Chad was so happy, he was blown away with the hospitality,” said Roberts.

“Do I expect Chael to get that? <strong>Absolutely not</strong>.”

Hah!  No, I don't think so either Mike.
