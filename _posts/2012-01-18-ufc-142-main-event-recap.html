He's back. Or at least the Aldo who blazed through the WEC, decimating opponents and fueling hype that is he the heir to the legacy of Anderson Silva is back. After fading against Mark Hominick in April 2011 and fighting conservatively against Kenny Florian in an "easy" victory in October 2011, a lot of pundits and fight fans saw Chad Mendes as the likely candidate to wrest the belt from the champ.  "Money" Mendes was going to use his powerful wrestling and hulking size to overwhelm and smother the champ. A flurry of columnists, mma journalists and fight fans all predicted Mendes being the shiny new featherweight champ. But then came the knee.

Mendes actually landed some nice early leg kicks and managed an extremely advantageous position late in the first round, securing Aldo's back while both were standing at the cage. Mendes delivered some nice knees to Aldo's legs and for a second, I was thinking he was gonna try a German Suplex or a body slam. In fact, Mendes had quickly slammed Aldo earlier in the round (after Aldo had grabbed the fence to briefly save himself). But upon separating himself from Mendes' grasp, Aldo turned and threw a perfectly placed knee as Mendes shot in again, blasting the contender's head. Mendes fell and Aldo delivered a few vicious strikes before the ref stepped in to stop the violence.

There is a defining characteristic of the elite in this sport. It's not landing the big kick, or the knock out punch, or even the slick submission. It is finishing your opponent during that short window of time between hurting them and their recovery. The most adept fighters will pounce IMMEDIATELY and be surgical with their striking precision. Look at Anderson Silva when he hurts someone. The follow-up is what's decisive in this case, and Anderson rarely misses. Same here with Aldo. Mendes was hurt with that knee, and within the blink of an eye Aldo was standing over him, throwing three powerful punches that further rocked his senses.  Impressive, fast work against the guy who was slated to give Aldo the most trouble of all his opponents.  Hey Hatsu Hioki, Dustin Poirier, Erik Koch, y'all better screen your calls. Joe Silva's gonna be calling, and you should probably not answer.
