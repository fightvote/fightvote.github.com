"Brazil, where hearts were entertaining June,
We stood beneath an amber moon
And softly murmured "someday soon."

&nbsp;

Back in Brazil where they no doubt will be going bonkers. And they should. This looks like a great card. Hats off to Anderson Silva for "saving" this card after Aldo went all Frank Mir and broke his foot in some motorcycle shenanigans. Let's get to the pics!

&nbsp;

MAIN CARD
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Anderson Silva vs. Stephan Bonnar</h2>
</li>
</ul>
Give Bonnar credit. The man has never been submitted or knocked out in the UFC and he's faced a who's won of challengers. But Anderson is so damn accurate with his strikes, Bonnar is in for a long night. If Bonnar's wrestling was better perhaps he's able to take Silva down. I'm a huge Bonnar fan, but I gotta be realistic.    SILVA by DECISION
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Dave Herman vs. Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira</h2>
</li>
</ul>
Nogueira is still Nogueiria but for how much longer?  This is his first fight since getting submitted by Frank Mir and having his arm go in a way it shouldn't. Herman had a lot of steam behind him when he came into the UFC and it's slowly dissipated. I really think Herman can pull off the upset but with Brazil at his back, Nogueira will probably get another one out.   NOGUEIRA by DECISION
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Fabio Maldonado vs. Glover Teixeira</h2>
</li>
</ul>
Teixeira is gonna win this on hype alone.  I do like Maldonado and piss blood every time I see one of his body shots land but Teixeira is not just a boxer and will mix it up here. Maldonado is a beast to finish however. TEIXEIRA by DECISION
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Jon Fitch vs. Erick Silva</h2>
</li>
</ul>
Fitch was the cock of the welterweight contender walk for about 45 years, but recent stumbles like the draw against BJ Penn and the KO to Hendricks has many wondering where is the Fitch of yesteryear. I think he's a bit banged up to weather the storm that is Erick Silva. Add to that the cheers of the Brazilian faithful and you got yourself a recipe for a new threat to GSP.   SILVA by TKO
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Phil Davis vs. Wagner Prado</h2>
</li>
</ul>
We never got to see this fight play out due to the eye poke last go around. Davis hasn't lost a step and I think his lats are just too much for Prado.  DAVIS by DECISION
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Demian Maia vs. Rick Story</h2>
</li>
</ul>
Tough call here. Maia lucked out over Stungun in his welterweight debut after Kim went down with a crazy muscle spasm. I don't think Maia's stand up is gonna give Story fits, and the American's wrestling should allow him to keep it standing.  I wouldn't be shocked to see Maia catch Story with a submission but Maia hasn't done that in 3 and a half years. Seriously. Look it up.    STORY by DECISION

PRELIMINARY CARD
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Rony "Jason" Mariano Bezerra vs. Sam Sicilia</h2>
</li>
</ul>
This isn't fair. Sicilia only has two names while Bezerra has three AND a nickname.  BEZERRA by BLANKA ROLL
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Gleison Tibau vs. Francisco Trinaldo</h2>
</li>
</ul>
How in the world Trinaldo was able to cut down to lightweight I don't know. The guy has anvils for fists but that's a LOT of weight cut. I think Tibau will exploit that and wear him down late. TIBAU by DECISION
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Diego Brandao vs. Joey Gambino</h2>
</li>
</ul>
I like Gambino. Just not especially for this fight. A trip to Brazil is a hard place to get your first UFC win and Brandao carries a lot of fire in his punches. Down the road I think Gambino can develop into a serious featherweight but it may be... ah screw it. Let's do it.  GAMBINO by DECISION
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Renee Forte vs. Sergio Moraes</h2>
</li>
</ul>
Not sure who Forte is but he trains Team Noguiera so maybe that's something. It should mean his jiu jitsu is sound at least. Moraes may try to drag him there and I expect this to be pretty close.  Meh.  MORAES by SUBMISSION
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Chris Camozzi vs. Luiz Cane</h2>
</li>
</ul>
Camozzi's looked good recently, and Cane has dropped 3 of his last 4, but he rights the ship here.   CANE by TKO
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>Reza Madadi vs. Cristiano Marcello</h2>
</li>
</ul>
Not a good start for the Brazilian faithful as I think  Madadi can keep away from Marcello's subs enough to land some big punches.   MADADI by KO.
