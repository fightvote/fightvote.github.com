<h1>Fight Vote Scoring Rules</h1>
<h2>Points are awarded for:</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Matchup: 10 pts.  </strong>Picking the correct matchup.  You get ten points for choosing the correct outcome of a matchup.</li>
	<li><strong>Underdog matchup bonus:  3 points.  </strong>If you pick a matchup which is an "extreme underdog" (where 66% of the people voting choose the opposite direction) you get the underdog bonus for that matchup.</li>
	<li><strong>Bonus matchup: 6 pts. </strong> One matchup is secretly designated before the card as the bonus matchup.  Correctly picking this matchup gives you an extra 6 points.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example scoring:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>If there are ten matchups, and you successfully pick 6 of the fights, you would get 60 points ( (6 x 10) == 60 ).</li>
	<li>If there are ten matchups, and you successfully pick 6 of them, and two are "extreme underdog" matchups, and you correctly pick one of these, then you would have 63 points  ( (6 x 10) + (1 x 3) == 63 ).</li>
	<li>If there are ten matchups, and you successfully pick 6 of them, and you successfully picked two extreme underdog matchups, and you picked the third matchup on the card which was the bonus matchup, then you would have 72 points ( (6 x 10) + (2 x 3) + 6 == 72 ).</li>
</ul>
